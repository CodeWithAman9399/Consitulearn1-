            <h1>1. Basic Operations & BODMAS</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The basic operations in mathematics are fundamental processes that form the foundation for most
                    mathematical calculations. These operations include:</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>1. Addition (+):</h2>
                <p>The process of combining two or more numbers to get a larger number.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    5 + 3 = 8</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>2. Subtraction (−):</h2>
                <p>The process of removing one number from another.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    7 − 4 = 3</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>3. Multiplication (×):</h2>
                <p>The process of adding a number to itself multiple times.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    6 × 3 = 18</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>4. Division (÷):</h2>
                <p>The process of splitting a number into equal parts.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                    12 ÷ 4 = 3</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>BODMAS Rule</h2>
                <p>BODMAS stands for Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication (from left to right), Addition and
                    Subtraction (from left to right). It is a set of rules that helps in determining the correct order
                    of operations to simplify expressions and avoid confusion.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>B - Brackets:</strong> First, solve expressions inside brackets (parentheses). Brackets
                        include round brackets (), square brackets [], and curly brackets {}.</li>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br> (5 + 3) × 2 = 8 × 2 = 16</p>

                    <li><strong>O - Orders:</strong> This includes powers or exponents, such as squares, cubes, square
                        roots, etc.</li>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br> 2³ = 8</p>

                    <li><strong>D and M - Division and Multiplication:</strong> After brackets and orders, division and
                        multiplication are performed from left to right. They have equal priority, so they are handled

                    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br> 10 ÷ 2 × 5 = 5 × 5 = 25</p>

                    <li><strong>A and S - Addition and Subtraction:</strong> Finally, addition and subtraction are
                        performed from left to right. These also have equal priority.</li>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong><br> 8 + 2 − 3 = 10 − 3 = 7</p>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Example of BODMAS in Action:</h2>
                <p>Simplify the following expression:</p>
                <p><strong>6 + (5 × 2) − 4 ÷ 2</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Brackets first<br>
                    6 + 10 − 4 ÷ 2</p>

                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Division<br>
                    6 + 10 − 2</p>

                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)<br>
                    16 − 2 = 14</p>

                <p>So, the result of the expression is 14.</p>

                <p>Following BODMAS ensures that we always perform calculations in the correct order and get the correct
                    results.</p>

                <h2>Word Problems Involving Linear Equations</h2>
                <p>Word problems are a practical way to apply linear equations to solve real-life situations. The key is
                    to translate the problem into a mathematical equation and then solve it. Here are some steps to
                    follow when solving word problems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Understand the problem:</b> Read the problem carefully to understand what is given and what
                        needs to be found.</li>
                    <li><b>Assign variables:</b> Let a variable represent the unknown quantity (e.g., <i>x</i>).</li>
                    <li><b>Set up the equation:</b> Use the information in the problem to form a linear equation.</li>
                    <li><b>Solve the equation:</b> Use algebraic methods to solve for the variable.</li>
                    <li><b>Check the solution:</b> Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

                <p>To solve an inequality, the goal is to find the range of values for the variable that makes the
                    inequality true. The steps for solving inequalities are similar to solving equations, but there are
                    a few key differences, especially when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.</p>

                    <li>Reverse the inequality sign if multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number.</li>
                    <li>Graph the solution (if needed), or express it in interval notation.</li>

                        starting from 4 and extending infinitely to the right. The point 4 is included in the solution,
                        represented by a closed circle.</li>
                    <li>For strict inequalities like x &lt; 3, the solution is represented by a shaded region to the
                        left of 3, and the point 3 is not included, represented by an open circle.</li>

                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <p>Solve x &le; 2 and graph the solution.</p>
                <p>The solution is all values of x less than or equal to 2.</p>
                <p>On the number line, you would draw a closed circle at 2 and shade to the left.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Budgeting and Finance:</b> Inequalities are used to represent constraints on spending. For
                        example, a person might have a budget of $500, and they need to make sure their total spending
                        doesn't exceed this amount.</li>
                    <li><b>Optimization Problems:</b> Inequalities are used to represent constraints in optimization
                        problems. For example, a company may need to maximize profit while respecting limits on
                        resources such as manpower, raw materials, or time.</li>
                    <li><b>Engineering and Physics:</b> Inequalities model physical limitations, such as maximum
                        capacity or safe limits. For example, the stress on a beam must not exceed a certain threshold
                        to ensure safety.</li>
                    <li><b>Population and Demographics:</b> Inequalities can be used to model population growth,
                        ensuring that the population size does not exceed a certain threshold.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Management:</b> Inequalities can model time constraints, such as needing to complete a
                        task within a set time.</li>

                <h2>2. Logarithms</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A logarithm is the inverse operation of exponentiation. It answers the question: "To what power
                        must a given base be raised to produce a certain number?"</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Logarithmic Form</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The logarithmic form is written as: <code>log<sub>b</sub> a = n</code>, which means
                        <code>b<sup>n</sup> = a</code>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>b</b> is the base of the logarithm, <b>a</b> is the argument (the number you're taking the
                        logarithm of), and <b>n</b> is the logarithm or the power.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Logarithms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Base 10 Logarithm (Common Logarithm):</b> log<sub>10</sub> a, often written as log a.</li>
                    <li><b>Base e Logarithm (Natural Logarithm):</b> log<sub>e</sub> a or ln a, where <i>e ≈ 2.718</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Base 2 Logarithm:</b> log<sub>2</sub> a, commonly used in computer science.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Properties of Logarithms</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Product Rule:</b> log<sub>b</sub>(a ⋅ c) = log<sub>b</sub> a + log<sub>b</sub> c</li>
                    <li><b>Quotient Rule:</b> log<sub>b</sub>(a / c) = log<sub>b</sub> a - log<sub>b</sub> c</li>
                    <li><b>Power Rule:</b> log<sub>b</sub> a<sup>n</sup> = n ⋅ log<sub>b</sub> a</li>
                    <li><b>Change of Base Rule:</b> log<sub>b</sub> a = log<sub>c</sub> a / log<sub>c</sub> b (where
                        <b>c</b> is any positive base)
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Logarithm of 1:</b> log<sub>b</sub> 1 = 0 (for any b > 0)</li>
                    <li><b>Logarithm of the Base:</b> log<sub>b</sub> b = 1</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>log<sub>2</sub> 8 = 3 because 2<sup>3</sup> = 8</li>
                    <li>log<sub>10</sub> 1000 = 3 because 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000</li>
                    <li>ln e<sup>5</sup> = 5 because e<sup>5</sup> = e<sup>5</sup></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Exponential Equation Example:</b> Solve 2<sup>x</sup> = 8. Express 8 as a power of 2:
                        2<sup>x</sup> = 2<sup>3</sup>. Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal: x = 3.

                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>These concepts are widely used in business, commerce, and financial transactions. They deal with
                        how much money is made or lost on a transaction, and how much a discount reduces the original
                        price of an item.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

                <ul>
                    <li>Profit is the positive difference between the selling price and the cost price. When the selling
                        price is greater than the cost price, the seller earns a profit.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Profit:

                    </li>
                    <li>Selling Price (SP): The price at which an item is sold.</li>
                    <li>Cost Price (CP): The price at which an item is bought or the cost to produce it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Profit Percentage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To calculate profit percentage, use the formula:
                        <p>Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the cost price of a product is $500, and it is sold for $600, the profit is:
                        <p>Profit = 600 - 500 = 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The profit percentage is:
                        <p>Profit Percentage = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%</p>

                <h2>ii. Loss</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Loss occurs when the selling price is less than the cost price. In this case, the seller sells
                        the product at a price lower than what was paid for it, resulting in a loss.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Loss:
                        <p>Loss = Cost Price (CP) - Selling Price (SP)</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Loss Percentage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To calculate the loss percentage, use the formula:
                        <p>Loss Percentage = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the cost price of a product is $500, and it is sold for $400, the loss is:
                        <p>Loss = 500 - 400 = 100</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The loss percentage is:
                        <p>Loss Percentage = (100 / 500) × 100 = 20%</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Discount is the reduction in the selling price of an item, usually given as a percentage of the
                        original price. It is commonly offered during sales or promotions to encourage customers to buy.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formula for Discount:
                        <p>Discount = (Discount Percentage / 100) × Marked Price (MP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Marked Price (MP): The original price of the item before any discount is applied.</li>
                    <li>Discount Percentage: The percentage of the discount offered.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Selling Price After Discount</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To find the selling price after the discount is applied, subtract the discount from the marked
                        price:
                        <p>Selling Price (SP) = Marked Price (MP) - Discount</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Example: If the marked price of a product is $1000 and a 20% discount is offered, the discount
                        amount is:
                        <p>Discount = (20 / 100) × 1000 = 200</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>The selling price after discount is:
                        <p>Selling Price = 1000 - 200 = 800</p>
                    </li>

                <h2>iv. Profit or Loss on Discounted Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In some cases, an item might be sold at a discount, but you want to know if there is still a
                        profit or loss. This can happen when the cost price is different from the discounted selling
                        price.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Profit or Loss with Discount:
                        <p>Profit or Loss = Selling Price after Discount - Cost Price</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interest is the cost of borrowing money or the return on investment for lending money. It is
                        usually calculated as a percentage of the principal (the initial amount of money) over a
                        specified period of time. The two main types of interest are Simple Interest and Compound
                        Interest.</li>

                        or investment. The interest does not accumulate on the previously earned interest.</li>
                    <li>Formula for Simple Interest:

                        formula:
                        <p>Overall Percentage Change = ((1 + p1 / 100) × (1 + p2 / 100) - 1) × 100</p>

                <h2>Explanation with Example</h2>
                <h3>Example 1: Two Successive Percentage Increases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose a product's price increases by 10% in the first year and 15% in the second year. To find
                        the overall percentage increase over the two years:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Change: 10% increase
                            <p>1 + 10 / 100 = 1.10</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Second Change: 15% increase
                            <p>1 + 15 / 100 = 1.15</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Now, calculate the overall percentage change:
                        <p>Overall Percentage Change = (1.10 × 1.15 - 1) × 100 = (1.265 - 1) × 100 = 0.265 × 100 = 26.5%
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the overall percentage increase is 26.5%.</li>

                <h3>Example 2: Successive Percentage Increase and Decrease</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now, consider a price increase of 20% followed by a price decrease of 10%. The formula works as
                        follows:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Change: 20% increase
                            <p>1 + 20 / 100 = 1.20</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Second Change: 10% decrease
                            <p>1 - 10 / 100 = 0.90</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Now calculate the overall percentage change:
                        <p>Overall Percentage Change = (1.20 × 0.90 - 1) × 100 = (1.08 - 1) × 100 = 0.08 × 100 = 8%</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the overall percentage change is an 8% increase.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why Adding Percentages Doesn’t Work</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It might seem intuitive to just add the percentages (for example, 10% + 15% = 25%), but this
                        approach doesn’t take into account the compounding effect, where the second change is applied to
                        the new value after the first change. This is why successive percentage changes must be
                        calculated using the formula rather than simply adding the percentages together.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Applications of Successive Percentage Change</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> Successive percentage changes are commonly used in retail
                        pricing, where the price of a product might increase in stages due to factors like inflation,
                        supply chain issues, or seasonal promotions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Investment Growth:</strong> Compound interest in investments, where returns are
                        generated on top of previous returns, involves successive percentage changes over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Taxation:</strong> When a new tax rate is applied to an amount already taxed, successive
                        percentage changes are involved.</li>
                    <li><strong>Discounts:</strong> Successive discounts can occur when a product is first offered at
                        one discount, and then another discount is applied to the already reduced price.</li>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the context of business, retail, and pricing, Marked Price and Selling Price are two key
                        terms used to describe the price of an item. Understanding the relationship between these prices
                        is important for calculating discounts, profits, and losses.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Marked Price (MP)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Marked Price is the original price that is listed or displayed on an item before any
                        discount or reduction is applied. It is the price at which a seller initially offers a product
                        for sale. This price is also sometimes referred to as the List Price or Sticker Price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Marked Price</strong></p> = The price tagged on the product. The Marked Price is usually
                        higher
                        than the Selling Price to allow for discounts and profit margins.</li>
                    <li>Example: A shirt is marked with a price tag of $500. This is the Marked Price.</li>
                </ul><hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

                <h2>ii. Selling Price (SP)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Selling Price is the actual price at which a product is sold to the customer after any
                        discount or reduction has been applied to the Marked Price. It can either be lower than or equal
                        to the Marked Price, depending on whether there is a discount or if the item is being sold at
                        full price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Selling Price</strong> = Marked Price - Discount</li>
                    <li>Example: If the shirt with a Marked Price of $500 is offered with a 20% discount, the Selling
                        Price would be:
                        <p><strong>Selling Price (SP)</strong> = 500 − (20 / 100 × 500) = 500 − 100 = 400</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>So, the Selling Price after discount is $400.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Relationship Between Marked Price, Selling Price, and Discount</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Selling Price (SP) is always related to the Marked Price (MP) through the Discount. The
                        formula is:
                        <p><strong>Selling Price</strong> = Marked Price − Discount</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Alternatively, if you know the Discount Percentage (D%), you can calculate the Discount as:
                        <p><strong>Discount</strong> = (Discount Percentage / 100) × Marked Price</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Profit and Loss with Marked Price and Selling Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profit:</strong> If the Selling Price is greater than the Cost Price (CP), a profit is
                        made. Profit is the difference between the Selling Price and the Cost Price:
                        <p><strong>Profit</strong> = Selling Price (SP) − Cost Price (CP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Loss:</strong> If the Selling Price is less than the Cost Price, a loss occurs. Loss is
                        the difference between the Cost Price and the Selling Price:
                        <p><strong>Loss</strong> = Cost Price (CP) − Selling Price (SP)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Profit or Loss Percentage:</strong> You can also calculate the profit percentage or loss
                        percentage based on the Cost Price:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Profit Percentage</strong> = (Profit / Cost Price) × 100</li>
                            <li><strong>Loss Percentage</strong> = (Loss / Cost Price) × 100</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Applications of Marked Price and Selling Price</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retail and Discounting:</strong> The most common use of Marked Price and Selling Price
                        is in retail, where stores offer discounts on the Marked Price to attract customers, thereby
                        selling at a Selling Price that is lower than the marked or original price.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing Strategy:</strong> Businesses set the Marked Price to determine how much they
                        want to sell the product for and allow flexibility for offering discounts during promotions or
                        clearance sales.</li>
                    <li><strong>Profit Calculation:</strong> Sellers often calculate their Profit by comparing the
                        Selling Price with the Cost Price, which helps in determining the financial success of the
                        transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consumer Shopping:</strong> Consumers often compare the Marked Price and the Selling
                        Price to assess the value of discounts or deals offered by retailers.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Interpreting tables and charts is essential in understanding and analyzing data. These tools
                        help visualize complex information, making it easier to spot trends, patterns, and
                        relationships. Here's a guide to interpreting them effectively.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Interpreting Tables</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A table is a way of presenting data in rows and columns. Each row usually represents an
                        individual record, and each column represents a particular attribute or variable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steps for Interpreting a Table:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Understand the Header:</strong> The header row tells you what each column represents
                            (e.g., name, age, sales, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify the Data Points:</strong> Each cell inside the table contains a data point
                            that corresponds to the row and column's intersection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Patterns or Trends:</strong> Scan the rows or columns for increases,
                            decreases, or consistency in values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Calculate Aggregates (if required):</strong> You may need to calculate totals,
                            averages, or percentages based on the table.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Example of a Table:</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Year | Sales (in $) | Profit (in $)</li>
                        <li>2019 | 5,000 | 800</li>
                        <li>2020 | 6,000 | 1,000</li>
                        <li>2021 | 7,000 | 1,200</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>From this table, you can quickly see that both sales and profits are increasing year by year.
                        The profit increases each year by $200, indicating a consistent growth in profitability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Interpreting Charts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Charts provide a graphical representation of data and can highlight trends and patterns that are
                        harder to identify in a table.</li>

                    <h3>Common Types of Charts and Their Interpretation:</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> A bar chart uses rectangular bars to represent data. The length
                            of each bar corresponds to the value of the variable being represented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Compare the height or length of the bars to understand the
                            relative size of the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A bar chart showing sales for various products will show which
                            product had the highest or lowest sales by the length of the bars.</li>

                        <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> A pie chart shows data as parts of a whole, with each slice
                            representing a category’s proportion of the total.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The size of each slice tells you the percentage or portion
                            of the whole. Larger slices indicate higher proportions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A pie chart showing market share of companies will show the
                            largest share for the biggest company and the smallest share for the smallest company.</li>

                        <li><strong>Line Graph:</strong> A line graph shows data points connected by a line, commonly
                            used for time series data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Observe the direction of the line—whether it’s increasing
                            or decreasing, and identify trends over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A line graph showing the temperature over a week will help you
                            identify the highest and lowest temperatures and whether the temperature is rising or
                            falling.</li>

                        <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> A histogram is similar to a bar chart, but it is used to
                            represent the distribution of numerical data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Look at the frequency of data within specific ranges
                            (bins). A taller bar means more data points fall within that range.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A histogram of ages will show which age groups have more or fewer
                            individuals.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Tips for Interpreting Tables and Charts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Understand the Axes and Labels:</strong> For charts, make sure you understand what each
                        axis represents. For tables, know what each row and column signifies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for Trends:</strong> Are values increasing or decreasing over time? In tables,
                        compare rows to identify this, and in charts, observe the slope of lines or bar heights.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compare Categories:</strong> Compare values across rows or columns in tables or bars in
                        charts to identify which category has the highest or lowest value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Context Matters:</strong> Always consider the context in which the data is presented.
                        For example, a sudden increase in a bar chart may indicate a seasonal change or a one-time
                        event.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calculate Averages or Totals:</strong> In tables, you may need to sum or average data to
                        gain insights (e.g., calculating the total sales over the years).</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for Outliers:</strong> Identify any data points that are significantly different
                        from the others. Outliers can be seen as spikes in line charts or bars in bar charts.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Both pie charts and bar graphs are visual tools used to represent data, making it easier to
                        interpret and compare values. They are commonly used in statistics, business analysis, and

                <h2>i. Pie Charts</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into slices to illustrate numerical
                        proportions. Each slice represents a category’s contribution to the whole, with the size of the
                        slice being proportional to the value it represents.</li>

                    <h3>Features of a Pie Chart:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Circle:</strong> Represents the total or 100% of a dataset.</li>
                        <li><strong>Slices:</strong> Each slice represents a category or a part of the whole.</li>
                        <li><strong>Percentage:</strong> The size of each slice indicates the percentage or fraction of
                            the total.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify the Categories:</strong> Each slice corresponds to a different category.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Analyze the Size of Slices:</strong> Larger slices represent categories with higher
                            proportions, and smaller slices represent categories with lower proportions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Check the Percentage:</strong> Most pie charts include percentage values that help
                            you understand the proportion of each category.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare the Slices:</strong> You can easily compare the relative sizes of the slices
                            to see which category is the largest or smallest.</li>

                <h2>ii. Bar Graphs</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A bar graph (also known as a bar chart) represents data with rectangular bars. The length or
                        height of each bar corresponds to the value of the category it represents. Bar graphs are widely
                        used to compare quantities across different categories.</li>

                    <h3>Features of a Bar Graph:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Bars:</strong> Each bar represents a category or group, and the length/height
                            indicates the magnitude of the value.</li>
                        <li><strong>Axes:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The x-axis (horizontal) typically represents the categories.</li>
                                <li>The y-axis (vertical) represents the values or quantities.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Steps to Interpret a Bar Graph:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Identify the Categories:</strong> The labels on the x-axis represent the categories
                            or groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examine the Length/Height of Bars:</strong> The longer or taller the bar, the
                            greater the value it represents.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compare Bars:</strong> Compare the lengths or heights of bars to identify which
                            categories have higher or lower values.</li>
                        <li><strong>Read the Values:</strong> The y-axis usually contains numerical values that indicate
                            the magnitude represented by the bars.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Example of a Bar Graph:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let’s say you have a bar graph representing the number of sales for different products:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Product A: 300</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>In the bar graph:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The height of the bar for Product B will be the highest, indicating it has the most
                                sales.</li>
                            <li>Product C will have the shortest bar, representing the least sales.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Advantages of Bar Graphs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy to compare values between different categories.</li>
                        <li>Can represent both small and large values effectively.</li>
                        <li>Can handle a wide range of categories and data types.</li>
                        <li>Can be used for both discrete and continuous data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Disadvantages of Bar Graphs:</h3>

                            (represented by a line) for a company over the year:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>January: Sales = $5000, Profit Margin = 10%</li>
                            <li>February: Sales = $6000, Profit Margin = 12%</li>
                            <li>March: Sales = $7000, Profit Margin = 15%</li>
                            <li>April: Sales = $8000, Profit Margin = 14%</li>
                            <li>May: Sales = $9000, Profit Margin = 16%</li>
                            <li>June: Sales = $10000, Profit Margin = 17%</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>In the mixed graph:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The bar graph will show the total sales each month.</li>
                            <li>The line graph will show the profit margin for each month.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>This allows you to compare how sales and profit margins move together or diverge over time.

                    <h3>Advantages of Mixed Graphs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Displays Multiple Data Sets: Good for comparing different variables that are related or
                            measured in different units.</li>
                        <li>More Information: Provides more information in a single graph, helping viewers understand
                            relationships between different types of data.</li>
                        <li>Multiple Data Representations: Allows you to use the best graph type for each data series,
                            improving clarity.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Disadvantages of Mixed Graphs:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Complexity: Mixed graphs can be harder to read, especially if there are too many data series
                            or axes.</li>
                        <li>Risk of Confusion: Multiple graph types and axes might confuse the viewer if not properly
                            labeled or explained.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Example of a Data Sufficiency Question:</h2>
                <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the value of x?</p>
                <p><strong>Statement I:</strong> 2x + 3 = 9</p>
                <p><strong>Statement II:</strong> x - 1 = 3</p>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Evaluation:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Question Understanding:</b> We need to find the value of x.</li>

                    <h4>Evaluating Statement I:</h4>
                    <p>From Statement I: 2x + 3 = 9</p>
                    <p>Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 6</p>
                    <p>Divide both sides by 2: x = 3</p>
                    <p>Statement I is sufficient to find x.</p>

                    <h4>Evaluating Statement II:</h4>
                    <p>From Statement II: x - 1 = 3</p>
                    <p>Add 1 to both sides: x = 4</p>
                    <p>Statement II is also sufficient to find x.</p>

                    <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
                    <p>Both statements provide sufficient information to answer the question. However, since each
                        statement gives a different value for x, they contradict each other. This suggests that the
                        information provided by the two statements is inconsistent, and we cannot determine the correct
                        value of x.</p>

                    <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> (E) Both statements together are not sufficient.</p>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Data Sufficiency Questions:</h2>

                <h3>i. Arithmetic-based questions:</h3>
                <p>These questions test your ability to perform basic calculations and interpret mathematical
                    operations.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> What is the sum of two numbers?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement I:</strong> The first number is 5.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement II:</strong> The second number is 7.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Combining both statements gives the sum as 12. So, both statements
                    together are sufficient.</p>

                <h3>ii. Algebraic equations:</h3>
                <p>These questions involve algebraic relationships. You may be asked to solve for variables or find
                    relationships between variables.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> What is the value of x + y?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement I:</strong> x = 3</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement II:</strong> y = 4</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Both statements give the value of the variables separately, so x + y = 7.
                    Hence, both statements together are sufficient.</p>

                <h3>iii. Geometry-based questions:</h3>
                <p>These questions test your ability to understand geometric shapes, properties, and relationships.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> What is the area of the circle?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement I:</strong> The radius of the circle is 5 cm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement II:</strong> The circumference of the circle is 31.4 cm.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Statement I alone gives the radius, and we can use the formula πr² to find
                    the area. Hence, Statement I alone is sufficient.</p>

                <h3>iv. Word Problems:</h3>
                <p>These questions often provide real-life scenarios or abstract problems and require you to apply
                    logical reasoning and mathematical knowledge.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> How many apples are there in the basket?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement I:</strong> The basket contains 5 apples.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statement II:</strong> There are 3 apples in each row, and there are 2 rows.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Combining both statements gives 3 × 2 = 6. So, both statements together
                    are sufficient.</p>

                <h2>Tips for Solving Data Sufficiency Questions:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoid Calculations in the Initial Step:</strong> Before jumping into calculations, first
                        evaluate whether the statement itself is sufficient to answer the question.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Logical Consistency:</strong> Look for contradictions or inconsistencies in the
                        statements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider Combining Statements:</strong> Sometimes combining two statements gives a
                        clearer picture. Always check if both statements together provide more than either one
                        individually.</li>
                    <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Data sufficiency problems can be tricky, so practice regularly to
                        understand the logic and reasoning behind each question type.</li>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>i. Average Speed</h2>
                <p>Average Speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken to travel
                    that distance.</p>
                <h3>Formula for Average Speed:</h3>
                <p><b>Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time</b></p>

                <p><b>Where:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Total Distance</b> = Sum of all distances traveled</li>
                    <li><b>Total Time</b> = Sum of all times taken</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Points about Average Speed:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Average speed does not depend on the speed at each individual point, but on the total distance
                        and total time.</li>
                    <li>If a person travels at different speeds over different distances or times, the average speed is
                        calculated by considering the total distance and total time taken.</li>
                </ul>

                    What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance 1 = 100 km, Speed 1 = 50 km/h, Time 1 = 100 / 50 = 2 hours</li>
                    <li>Distance 2 = 100 km, Speed 2 = 100 km/h, Time 2 = 100 / 100 = 1 hour</li>
                    <li>Total Distance = 100 + 100 = 200 km</li>
                    <li>Total Time = 2 + 1 = 3 hours</li>
                    <li>Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 200 / 3 = 66.67 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 66.67 km/h.</p>

                <h2>ii. Relative Speed</h2>
                <p>Relative Speed refers to the speed of one object with respect to another object. It is useful when
                    two objects are moving in the same or opposite directions.</p>

                <h3>If two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of their
                    speeds:</h3>
                <p><b>Relative Speed = Speed of A - Speed of B</b> (where Speed A is the speed of the faster object and
                    Speed B is the speed of the slower object).</p>

                <h3>If two objects are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds:
                </h3>
                <p><b>Relative Speed = Speed of A + Speed of B</b></p>

                <h3>Example 2:</h3>
                <p>Two cars are moving towards each other. Car A moves at 60 km/h and Car B moves at 40 km/h. What is
                    their relative speed?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since the cars are moving towards each other (opposite directions), the relative speed is:</li>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The relative speed is 100 km/h.</p>

                <h3>Example 3:</h3>
                <p>Two trains are moving in the same direction. Train A moves at 80 km/h and Train B moves at 60 km/h.
                    What is their relative speed?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since the trains are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is:</li>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 80 - 60 = 20 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The relative speed is 20 km/h.</p>

                <h2>iii. Time Taken to Meet (Relative Speed Approach)</h2>
                <p>When two objects move towards each other, the time taken for them to meet can be found using the
                    formula:</p>
                <p><b>Time = Distance between them / Relative Speed</b></p>

                <h3>Example 4:</h3>
                <p>Two cars are 200 km apart and are moving towards each other. Car A moves at 60 km/h and Car B moves
                    at 40 km/h. How long will it take for them to meet?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relative Speed = 60 + 40 = 100 km/h</li>
                    <li>Distance between them = 200 km</li>
                    <li>Time = 200 / 100 = 2 hours</li>

                <h2>iv. Time Taken to Cross Each Other (Relative Speed Approach)</h2>
                <p>When two objects (e.g., trains, cars) are moving in opposite directions and need to pass each other
                    completely, the time taken for them to cross each other is:</p>
                <p><b>Time to Cross = Sum of the lengths of both objects / Relative Speed</b></p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Example 5:</h3>

                    and Train B moves at 40 km/h. How much time will they take to cross each other?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convert the speeds into meters per second:
                        <ul>
                            <li>60 km/h = 60 × 1000 / 3600 = 16.67 m/s</li>
                            <li>40 km/h = 40 × 1000 / 3600 = 11.11 m/s</li>

            <h1>2. Boats & Streams Problems</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Boats & Streams problems are a common type of question in competitive exams involving the concept of
                    relative speed in moving objects. These problems usually involve a boat moving in a river, and the
                    stream’s current influences the boat’s motion. These questions test your ability to calculate the
                    effective speed of the boat and how it is affected by the stream's current.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Boat in Still Water:</b> This is the speed of the boat when there is no current
                        in the river. Denoted as <b>B</b> (speed of boat in still water).</li>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Stream (Current):</b> This is the speed at which the water of the stream moves.
                        Denoted as <b>S</b> (speed of stream).</li>
                    <li><b>Effective Speed of the Boat in the Stream:</b></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the boat is moving <b>downstream</b> (in the direction of the current), the current
                            assists the boat, so the effective speed is the sum of the speed of the boat in still water
                            and the speed of the stream: <b>Effective Speed Downstream = B + S</b></li>
                        <li>When the boat is moving <b>upstream</b> (against the current), the current opposes the boat,
                            so the effective speed is the difference between the speed of the boat in still water and
                            the speed of the stream: <b>Effective Speed Upstream = B - S</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <h2>Types of Boats & Streams Problems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speed of the Boat & Stream:</b> These problems usually ask you to calculate the speed of the
                        boat or the stream when the effective speed downstream or upstream is given.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Taken to Travel a Certain Distance:</b> These problems involve calculating the time
                        taken by the boat to cover a certain distance, either downstream or upstream.</li>
                    <li><b>Meeting or Crossing Point:</b> Sometimes, two boats moving in opposite or the same direction
                        are asked to meet or cross each other. The speed of the stream affects their meeting time.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>A boat travels 40 km downstream in 4 hours and 40 km upstream in 5 hours. What is the speed of the
                    boat in still water and the speed of the stream?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p><b>Downstream Speed:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance = 40 km, Time = 4 hours</li>
                    <li>Speed downstream = 40 / 4 = 10 km/h</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Upstream Speed:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Distance = 40 km, Time = 5 hours</li>
                    <li>Speed upstream = 40 / 5 = 8 km/h</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let the speed of the boat in still water be <b>B</b> km/h, and the speed of the stream be <b>S</b>
                    km/h.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Downstream Speed:</b> B + S = 10</li>
                    <li><b>Upstream Speed:</b> B - S = 8</li>
                </ul>

                <p>By solving these two equations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>(B + S) = 10</li>
                    <li>(B - S) = 8</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Add both equations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2B = 18 ⇒ B = 9 km/h</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Substitute <b>B = 9</b> into <b>B + S = 10</b>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>9 + S = 10 ⇒ S = 1 km/h</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Answer:</b> The speed of the boat in still water is 9 km/h, and the speed of the stream is 1 km/h.

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Circular motion problems and race-related problems are commonly found in competitive exams. These
                    problems typically involve understanding concepts related to the motion of objects along circular
                    paths (like a car on a circular track) or the time it takes for different objects to cover specific
                    distances, such as in races.</p>

                <h2>Circular Motion Problems</h2>
                <p>Circular motion refers to the motion of an object in a circular path. When objects move in a circle,
                    they are said to undergo uniform circular motion if their speed remains constant. For objects moving
                    in circular paths, key concepts like angular velocity, linear velocity, and centripetal force come
                    into play.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts of Circular Motion:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Linear Velocity (Tangential Speed):</b> The speed of an object moving along a circular path,
                        denoted by <b>v</b>. It is the distance traveled per unit time along the circumference of the
                        circle.</li>
                    <pre>v = r * ω</pre>
                    <li><b>Angular Velocity (ω):</b> The rate at which an object moves through an angle in a circular
                        path. It is measured in radians per second (rad/s).</li>
                    <pre>ω = θ / t</pre>
                    <li><b>Centripetal Force:</b> The force that keeps an object moving in a circular path is called the
                        centripetal force. This force is always directed toward the center of the circle.</li>
                    <pre>F = m * v² / r</pre>
                    <li><b>Period of Revolution (T):</b> The time taken for one complete revolution of the object around
                        the circular path.</li>
                    <pre>T = 2πr / v</pre>
                    <li><b>Frequency (f):</b> The number of revolutions completed per unit time. It is the reciprocal of
                        the period.</li>
                    <pre>f = 1 / T</pre>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of Circular Motion Problems:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Time Taken for One Complete Revolution:</b> These problems involve calculating the time taken
                        for an object to complete one full circle along a circular track or path.</li>
                    <li><b>Speed of an Object in Circular Motion:</b> These problems involve finding the linear speed
                        (tangential speed) or angular velocity of an object moving in a circular path.</li>

                <h3>Example 1:</h3>
                <p>A car is moving along a circular track with a radius of 100 meters. If the car completes one full
                    revolution in 20 seconds, what is the speed of the car?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p><b>Step 1:</b> The distance covered in one revolution is the circumference of the circle:</p>
                <pre>Circumference = 2πr = 2π × 100 = 628.31 meters</pre>

                <p><b>Step 2:</b> The time taken for one revolution is 20 seconds.</p>

                <p><b>Step 3:</b> The speed <b>v</b> is the distance divided by the time:</p>
                <pre>v = Circumference / Time = 628.31 / 20 = 31.42 m/s</pre>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Work, efficiency, and wages problems are commonly found in competitive exams, especially in
                    quantitative reasoning sections. These problems involve concepts of time, work, and the amount of
                    money earned based on the work done.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Work:</h3>
                <p>Work refers to the completion of a task or job. In these problems, the work is generally expressed in
                    terms of the "amount of work" or "units of work."</p>

                <h3>Efficiency:</h3>
                <p>Efficiency refers to how much work a person or machine can complete in a given time. In work-related
                    problems, efficiency is often stated as a fraction of the total work done per unit of time.</p>

                <h3>Time:</h3>
                <p>Time is the duration taken to complete the work. The time taken to complete the work depends on the
                    efficiency of the worker or machine.</p>

                <h3>Wages:</h3>
                <p>Wages refer to the payment for work done. In these problems, wages are generally calculated based on
                    the amount of work completed, and the amount paid is proportional to the work done.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Formulae:</h2>
                <h3>Work-Rate Relationship:</h3>
                <p>If a person completes a work in <b>T</b> days, the work rate of that person is <b>1/T</b> of the
                    total work per day.</p>
                <pre>Work Rate of A = 1 / T<sub>A</sub> work/day</pre>
                <pre>Work Rate of B = 1 / T<sub>B</sub> work/day</pre>

                <h3>Combined Work Rate:</h3>
                <p>When two or more people work together, their combined rate of work is the sum of their individual
                    rates.</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / T<sub>A</sub> + 1 / T<sub>B</sub></pre>

                <h3>Work Formula:</h3>
                <p>Work is the product of rate and time. So, if a person works for <b>t</b> days at a rate of <b>r</b>,
                    the total work done is:</p>
                <pre>Work = r × t</pre>

                <h3>Wages Calculation:</h3>
                <p>Wages are often directly proportional to the work done. If a person completes a fraction <b>1/n</b>
                    of the work, they receive <b>1/n</b> of the total wages. If the total wages for the full work are
                    <b>W</b>, the wage earned for completing <b>1/n</b> of the work is:
                </p>
                <pre>Wages = (Work Done / Total Work) × W</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Problems on Work, Efficiency, and Wages:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Individual Work and Time Problems:</b> Calculate how long it takes for an individual to
                        complete a task based on their efficiency.</li>
                    <li><b>Combined Work Problems:</b> When multiple workers work together, find the total time taken or

            <h1>2. Pipes & Cisterns Problems</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Pipes and cisterns problems deal with the filling or emptying of a tank or cistern using pipes with
                    different rates of flow. The key concepts are related to the rates at which water flows into or out
                    of the tank, and the time taken to fill or empty the tank. These problems are often based on the
                    concepts of work, efficiency, and rates.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

                <h3>Filling and Emptying:</h3>
                <p>A pipe filling the cistern is considered to add water to the cistern. A pipe emptying the cistern is
                    considered to remove water from the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Rate of Flow:</h3>
                <p>If a pipe fills the cistern in <b>T</b> hours, its rate of flow is <b>1/T</b> cisterns per hour. If a
                    pipe empties the cistern in <b>T</b> hours, its rate of flow is <b>-1/T</b> cisterns per hour
                    (negative because it's emptying).</p>

                <h3>Combined Rates:</h3>
                <p>When multiple pipes are working together, the total rate of flow is the sum of the individual rates.
                    If a pipe fills the cistern and another empties it, the combined rate is the difference between the
                    filling and emptying rates.</p>
                <pre>Combined Rate = 1 / T<sub>1</sub> - 1 / T<sub>2</sub></pre>
                <p>Where <b>T<sub>1</sub></b> is the time taken to fill the cistern and <b>T<sub>2</sub></b> is the time
                    taken to empty it.</p>

                <h3>Time Taken:</h3>
                <p>The time taken to fill or empty the cistern is the inverse of the combined rate of the pipes.</p>

                <h2>Formulas:</h2>

                <h3>Filling Rate:</h3>
                <pre>Filling Rate = 1 / T</pre>
                <p>Where <b>T</b> is the time taken to fill the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Emptying Rate:</h3>
                <pre>Emptying Rate = -1 / T</pre>
                <p>Where <b>T</b> is the time taken to empty the cistern.</p>

                <h3>Combined Rate (When pipes are working together):</h3>
                <pre>Combined Rate = Filling Rate + Emptying Rate</pre>
                <p>If the pipes are working against each other, the emptying rate is negative.</p>

                <h3>Time to Fill or Empty:</h3>
                <pre>Time to Fill or Empty = 1 / Combined Rate</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Problems:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Filling or Emptying the Cistern:</b> These problems ask how long it takes for a pipe or
                        combination of pipes to fill or empty the cistern.</li>
                    <li><b>Combined Filling and Emptying:</b> These problems involve two or more pipes working together
                        (one filling, one emptying), and the goal is to find the time taken to fill or empty the
                        cistern.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Required When a Pipe is Turned Off:</b> These problems ask for the time it will take to
                        fill the cistern after one pipe has been turned off, or when only one pipe remains open.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Examples and Solutions:</h2>

                <h3>Example 1: Filling and Emptying Problem</h3>
                <p>A pipe can fill a cistern in 10 hours, while another pipe can empty the same cistern in 15 hours. How
                    long will it take to fill the cistern if both pipes are open?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The filling rate of the first pipe (filling pipe) is:</p>
                <pre>1 / 10 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The emptying rate of the second pipe (emptying pipe) is:</p>
                <pre>-1 / 15 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The combined rate of both pipes working together is:</p>
                <pre>1 / 10 - 1 / 15 = 3 / 30 - 2 / 30 = 1 / 30 cistern/hour</pre>
                <p>The time taken to fill the cistern is:</p>
                <pre>Time = 1 / (1 / 30) = 30 hours</pre>
                <p>So, it will take 30 hours to fill the cistern when both pipes are open.</p>

                <h3>Total Work:</h3>
                <p>The total amount of work is usually taken as 1 unit (representing the complete task).</p>

                <h3>Combined Work:</h3>
                <p>When two or more people work together, the total rate of work is the sum of their individual rates of

                <p>A and B together can complete a task in 6 days. If A can complete the task alone in 8 days, how
                    should the wages of 240 be distributed between A and B?</p>

                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The rate of work of A is <b>1/8</b> (A completes the task in 8 days).</p>
                <p>The rate of work of A and B together is <b>1/6</b> (A and B together complete the task in 6 days).
                </p>

                <p>The rate of work of B alone is:</p>
                <pre>Rate of B = 1/6 - 1/8 = 4/24 - 3/24 = 1/24</pre>
                <p>So, B takes 24 days to complete the task alone.</p>

                <p>The work done by A in one day is <b>1/8</b> and the work done by B in one day is <b>1/24</b>.</p>

                <p>The total work rate is:</p>
                <pre>Total Rate = 1/8 + 1/24 = 3/24 + 1/24 = 4/24 = 1/6</pre>

                <p>The share of wages for A is proportional to A's work rate:</p>
                <pre>Wages for A = 240 × (1/8) / (1/6) = 240 × (6/8) = 240 × (3/4) = 180</pre>

                <p>The share of wages for B is proportional to B's work rate:</p>
                <pre>Wages for B = 240 × (1/24) / (1/6) = 240 × (6/24) = 240 × (1/4) = 60</pre>

                <p>So, A should receive 180 and B should receive 60 from the total wages of 240.</p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>In physics and mathematics, negative work and reverse work refer to situations where the work done by

                    reducing the amount of work done. These concepts are essential when analyzing forces acting on
                    objects and understanding how different forces influence the movement or energy of a system.</p>

                <h2>i. Negative Work</h2>
                <p>Negative work occurs when the force applied to an object is in the opposite direction of the object's

                <p>where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>W</b> is the work done</li>
                    <li><b>F</b> is the magnitude of the force applied</li>
                    <li><b>d</b> is the displacement of the object</li>
                    <li><b>θ</b> is the angle between the force and the displacement vector</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Negative work occurs when <b>θ > 90°</b>. In such cases, the force acts opposite to the direction of
                    displacement, and the cosine of an angle greater than 90 degrees is negative.</p>

                <h3>Example of Negative Work:</h3>
                <p>If a person is pushing a box to the right, but friction is acting in the opposite direction (to the
                    left), then friction does negative work. The force of friction slows down the box as it moves to the
                    right.</p>
                <p>In this case:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The displacement of the box is to the right (positive direction).</li>
                    <li>The force of friction acts to the left (negative direction).</li>
                    <li>The angle between the displacement and force direction is 180°, which makes <b>cos(180°) =
                            -1</b>, so the work done by friction is negative.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mathematical Example:</h3>
                <p>If a box of mass 5 kg is pushed to the right for 10 meters, and the frictional force is 2 N acting
                    opposite to the direction of motion:</p>
                <pre>W = F × d × cos(180°)</pre>
                <pre>W = 2 × 10 × (-1) = -20 Joules</pre>
                <p>The work done by the friction is -20 Joules, indicating that energy is being taken away from the box.

                <h2>ii. Reverse Work</h2>
                <p>Reverse work refers to a scenario where the direction of the force applied is reversed after
                    performing positive work. It can occur in situations where a worker or machine begins to reverse the
                    process that was initially done (i.e., reducing the effect of work done earlier).</p>

                <h3>Reverse Work in Human Effort:</h3>
                <p>In the context of human labor, reverse work can be interpreted as situations where a person who was
                    initially performing a task (e.g., lifting or carrying an object) stops the task or does the
                    opposite (e.g., lowering or pushing the object back).</p>

                <h3>Example of Reverse Work:</h3>
                <p>Consider a scenario where you lift a box (positive work) and then lower it (reverse work):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Lifting:</b> Work is done in the direction of the applied force (positive work).</li>
                    <li><b>Lowering:</b> Work is done in the opposite direction, and the force is exerted downward to
                        counteract gravity. This results in negative or reverse work.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Work and Energy Concept:</h3>
                <p>In reverse work, energy is transferred in the opposite direction. For instance, lowering a lifted
                    object means the gravitational potential energy is reduced, and the energy is given back to the
                    environment.</p>

                <h3>Mathematical Example:</h3>
                <p>If you lift a box with a force of 50 N for 2 meters, the work done is:</p>
                <pre>W = 50 × 2 = 100 Joules (positive work)</pre>
                <p>If you then lower the box by 2 meters with the same force, the reverse work is:</p>
                <pre>W = 50 × 2 = 100 Joules (negative or reverse work)</pre>
                <p>The reverse work here takes away the energy that was initially imparted to the box by lifting it.</p>

                <h2>Practical Examples of Negative and Reverse Work:</h2>
                <h3>Example 1: Negative Work in a Car Braking:</h3>
                <p>When a car is moving forward, and the brakes are applied, the friction between the tires and the road
                    slows down the car. This is an example of negative work. The car moves in the direction of its
                    velocity, while the frictional force opposes the motion. The brakes are performing negative work by
                    reducing the car’s kinetic energy.</p>

            <h1>Basic Probability Concepts</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with calculating the likelihood or chance of an
                    event occurring. It is widely used in various fields such as statistics, finance, gaming, and
                    science.</p>

                <h2>i. What is Probability?</h2>
                <p>Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.
                </p>
                <p>The probability of an event (P(E)) is given by:</p>
                <pre>P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes</pre>
                <p>where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>P(E)</b> is the probability of event E.</li>
                    <li>The numerator is the number of favorable outcomes (the outcomes we are interested in).</li>
                    <li>The denominator is the total number of possible outcomes (all outcomes that could possibly
                        occur).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Types of Events</h2>
                <h3>Certain Event:</h3>
                <p>An event that is guaranteed to occur.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The probability of rolling a number between 1 and 6 on a standard die is 1 (i.e.,
                    P(Rolling 1-6) = 1).</p>

                <h3>Impossible Event:</h3>
                <p>An event that cannot occur.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> The probability of rolling a 7 on a standard 6-sided die is 0 (i.e., P(Rolling 7) =
                    0).</p>

                <h3>Simple Event:</h3>
                <p>An event that has only one outcome.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Rolling a 4 on a standard die.</p>

                <h3>Compound Event:</h3>
                <p>An event that involves two or more simple events happening together.</p>
                <p><b>Example:</b> Rolling an even number (i.e., 2, 4, or 6) on a standard die.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Basic Probability Rules</h2>
                <h3>The Probability of the Sample Space:</h3>
                <p>The probability of the entire sample space (all possible outcomes) is always 1.</p>
                <pre>P(Sample Space) = 1</pre>

                <h3>The Probability of Complementary Events:</h3>
                <p>The probability of the complement of an event A (i.e., the event that A does not occur) is given by:
                </p>
                <pre>P(A') = 1 - P(A)</pre>
                <p>where P(A') is the probability of event A not happening.</p>

                <h3>Addition Rule:</h3>
                <p>The addition rule is used to find the probability of the occurrence of either of two events. For two
                    events A and B:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>For mutually exclusive events</b> (events that cannot happen at the same time):<br />
                        <pre>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>For non-mutually exclusive events</b> (events that can happen at the same time):<br />
                        <pre>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Multiplication Rule:</h3>
                <p>The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of two independent events happening together:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>For independent events</b> (events that do not affect each other):<br />
                        <pre>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>For dependent events</b> (events where the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the
                        other):<br />
                        <pre>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B|A)</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>where P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B occurring given that A has already occurred.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Conditional Probability</h2>
                <p>Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already
                    occurred. It is represented as P(A|B), the probability of event A occurring given event B.</p>
                <p>The formula for conditional probability is:</p>
                <pre>P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)</pre>
                <p>where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>P(A ∩ B) is the probability that both A and B occur.</li>
                    <li>P(B) is the probability that event B occurs.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Sample Space and Events</h2>
                <p>The sample space (denoted S) is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. An event is
                    any subset of the sample space.</p>

                <h3>Example 1: Rolling a Die</h3>
                <pre>Sample space S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}</pre>
                <p>Event A: Rolling an even number A = {2, 4, 6}</p>
                <p>Event B: Rolling a number greater than 4 B = {5, 6}</p>
                <p>The probability of event A is:</p>
                <pre>P(A) = Number of favorable outcomes for A / Total number of outcomes = 3 / 6 = 0.5</pre>

                <h3>Example 2: Tossing a Coin</h3>
                <pre>Sample space S = {H, T} (H for heads, T for tails)</pre>
                <p>Event A: Getting heads A = {H}</p>
                <p>The probability of event A is:</p>
                <pre>P(A) = 1 / 2 = 0.5</pre>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vi. Types of Probability</h2>
                <h3>Theoretical Probability:</h3>
                <p>This is based on the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely. For example, when tossing a
                    fair coin, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 because there are two equally likely outcomes:
                    heads or tails.</p>

                <h3>Experimental Probability:</h3>
                <p>This is based on observed outcomes of an experiment. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of
                    times an event occurs to the total number of trials.</p>
                <pre>P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of trials</pre>
                <p>For example, if a die is rolled 100 times and the number 6 appears 20 times, the experimental
                    probability of rolling a 6 is 20/100 = 0.2.</p>

                <h3>Empirical Probability:</h3>
                <p>Similar to experimental probability, but typically based on a larger set of data or experiments.</p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vii. Law of Large Numbers</h2>
                <p>The Law of Large Numbers states that as the number of trials or experiments increases, the
                    experimental probability of an event will approach the theoretical probability. For example, if you
                    flip a fair coin many times, the proportion of heads should approach 0.5 as the number of flips
                    increases.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>viii. Probability Distribution</h2>
                <p>A probability distribution is a function that gives the probability of each outcome in a sample
                    space. There are two main types of probability distributions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Discrete Probability Distribution:</b> For events with a finite number of possible outcomes
                        (e.g., rolling a die).</li>
                    <li><b>Continuous Probability Distribution:</b> For events with an infinite number of possible
                        outcomes (e.g., the probability of selecting a number from a continuous range).</li>

                    <li>A probability distribution describes how the probabilities are distributed over the values of a
                        random variable.</li>
                    <li>It provides a function that gives the probability of each possible outcome in an experiment or
                        random process.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Coordinate Geometry (also called Analytical Geometry) uses a coordinate system to represent
                        geometric shapes and solve problems related to lines, curves, and shapes using algebraic
                        equations.</li>
                    <li>It combines algebra and geometry by using coordinates on a plane to represent points and define
                        shapes.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Cartesian plane is a 2D grid formed by two perpendicular number lines, the X-axis
                        (horizontal) and the Y-axis (vertical).</li>
                    <li>The point of intersection of the X-axis and Y-axis is called the origin, denoted as \( O(0, 0)
                        \).</li>
                    <li>The plane is divided into four quadrants:

                <ul>
                    <li>Coding-Decoding is a reasoning technique that involves transforming a given set of numbers,
                        letters, or symbols into codes based on certain rules. The objective is to identify the pattern
                        or logic behind the transformation.</li>

                <h2>Letter Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In letter coding, each letter of the alphabet is replaced by another letter according to a fixed
                        rule. The rule can be based on shifting positions, reversing the alphabet, or other
                        manipulations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Letter Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Shift in Alphabet</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → C, B → D, C → E, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: Each letter is shifted by +2.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → F</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Reverse Alphabet Coding</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → Z, B → Y, C → X, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: Reverse the alphabet.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → W</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Positional Shift</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: A → 1, B → 2, C → 3, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The letters are replaced by their position numbers.</li>
                    <li>Answer: D → 4</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Number Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In number coding, a number is replaced by another number based on some mathematical
                        relationship, which could be addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or powers.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Number Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Simple Arithmetic Operations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 3 → 6, 4 → 12, 5 → 20, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is multiplied by its position.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 6 × 5 = 30</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Squares or Cubes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 2 → 4, 3 → 9, 4 → 16, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is squared.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 5 → 25</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Prime Numbers or Factors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: 3 → 9, 5 → 25, 7 → 49, ___</li>
                    <li>Pattern: The number is squared.</li>
                    <li>Answer: 11 → 121</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Symbol Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>In symbol coding, special symbols like #, $, %, *, &, etc., are used in place of numbers or
                        letters. The key here is to decode the meaning of each symbol and how they relate to numbers or
                        letters.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Types of Symbol Coding Patterns</h3>
                <h4>Symbols Representing Operations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: # means +, * means -, % means ×.</li>
                    <li>Code: 6 # 3 * 2 % 4 → (6 + 3) - 2 × 4 → 9 - 2 × 4 = 9 - 8 = 1.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Substitution of Symbols with Numbers or Letters</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: * represents multiplication, % represents division.</li>
                    <li>Code: 5 * 4 % 2 → 5 × 4 ÷ 2 = 20 ÷ 2 = 10.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Common Approaches to Solve Coding-Decoding Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for Arithmetic Patterns: Identify if the numbers or letters are related through addition,
                        subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponentiation.</li>
                    <li>Position and Shifting: Sometimes, positions in the alphabet (or the number line) are key. Look
                        for consistent shifting patterns (e.g., shifting a letter by +2 in the alphabet).</li>
                    <li>Reverse and Symmetry: Some codes might use reverse positions, such as reversing the alphabet or
                        number sequences.</li>
                    <li>Understand Symbol Operations: If symbols are involved, carefully analyze the operation they
                        represent, like +, -, ×, ÷.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>If today is Monday, what day will it be 100 days from now?</li>
                    <li>Divide 100 by 7 (the number of days in a week): 100 ÷ 7 = 14 weeks and a remainder of 2.</li>
                    <li>So, 100 days from Monday will be 2 days ahead, which is Wednesday.</li>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logical deduction refers to the process of drawing conclusions based on given facts, rules, or
                        premises.</li>
                    <li>It is a critical skill in many areas such as mathematics, philosophy, and competitive exams.
                    </li>
                    <li>In logical deduction problems, you are provided with a set of conditions, and your task is to
                        infer the correct relationships or conclusions from those conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Logical Deduction Problems</h2>
                <h3>Syllogism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Syllogism is a type of logical argument where a conclusion is drawn from two given or assumed
                        propositions (premises).</li>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Premise 1:</b> All men are mortal.</li>
                            <li><b>Premise 2:</b> Socrates is a man.</li>
                            <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Socrates is mortal.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <p>Syllogism problems typically involve two premises, and you need to deduce the correct conclusion
                        based on the given facts.</p>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Premise 1:</b> All dogs are animals.</li>
                        <li><b>Premise 2:</b> Fido is a dog.</li>
                        <li><b>Conclusion:</b> Fido is an animal.</li>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b> The conclusion is valid, as it follows from the premises.</li>

                <h3>Puzzle-based Logical Deductions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>These puzzles involve a set of conditions that describe relationships between different items or
                        entities. You need to use these conditions to deduce certain facts or answer questions.</li>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <p>There are four friends: A, B, C, and D.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A is taller than B.</li>
                        <li>C is taller than D.</li>
                        <li>B is shorter than D.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Question:</h4>
                    <p>Who is the tallest among the four friends?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A > B (A is taller than B).</li>

                        <li>B < D (B is shorter than D).</li>
                        <li>Since A is taller than B, and B is shorter than D, we conclude that C is the tallest, as
                            there is no restriction on C's height relative to A.</li>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b> C is the tallest.</li>

                        <li>Finally, he turns right again (South) and walks 10 meters.</li>
                        <li>Since the total vertical displacement (North-South) is 0 (10 meters North and 10 meters
                            South), the person is directly East of the starting point.</li>

                        my father’s son." Who is in the photograph?</p>

                            in the photograph is her son because her father’s son would be her brother, and the father

                <ul>
                    <li>Logical deduction can also involve analyzing a statement and inferring whether the assumption
                        based on it is true or false.</li>
                    <h3>Example Problem:</h3>
                    <p>Statement: "No birds are mammals." Assumption: "All birds are non-mammals."</p>
                    <h4>Solution:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The statement is saying that no birds are mammals, which implies that all birds are
                            non-mammals. Thus, the assumption is true.</li>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b> The assumption is correct.</li>

                <h2>Approaching Logical Deduction Problems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the problem carefully: Understand all the conditions or premises provided.</li>
                    <li>Break down the problem: Identify key facts and relationships that are mentioned.</li>
                    <li>Use process of elimination: In some cases, you can eliminate incorrect options and deduce the
                        correct answer.</li>
                    <li>Draw diagrams if necessary: Sometimes, drawing a Venn diagram, family tree, or chart helps
                        visualize relationships and makes deductions easier.</li>
                    <li>Consider all possibilities: When you’re unsure about a problem, list all possible scenarios and
                        narrow them down based on the given conditions.</li>

                <h2>Common Types of Mathematical Puzzles and Riddles</h2>
                <h3>1. Classic Number Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 1: The Missing Dollar Riddle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Three friends check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10, and
                    the hotel clerk gives them a $5 discount because of an overcharge. The clerk gives $1 back to each
                    friend and keeps $2 for himself. Now, each friend has paid $9 (totaling $27), and the clerk has kept
                    $2. Where did the extra dollar go?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>This puzzle is often misleading because it suggests a discrepancy in the way the amounts are being
                    added.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The total amount paid is $30.</li>
                    <li>Each friend gets $1 back, so they have paid $9 each, totaling $27.</li>
                    <li>Out of this $27, $25 is for the room, and $2 is kept by the clerk.</li>
                    <li>There is no missing dollar; the confusion comes from adding the $2 (the clerk's tip) to the $27,
                        which is incorrect. The $27 already includes the $2 kept by the clerk.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The riddle plays on a logical error in the way the amounts are added.</p>

                <h3>2. Word-based Mathematical Riddles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 2: The Bridge and Torch Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have one torch, and the bridge can
                    only hold two people at a time. The crossing times are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Person 1: 1 minute</li>
                    <li>Person 2: 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Person 3: 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Person 4: 10 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The torch must be walked back each time, and two people can cross together, but they must move at the
                    slower person's pace. What is the shortest time in which all four people can cross the bridge?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>First crossing: Person 1 and Person 2 cross together (2 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Return: Person 1 goes back with the torch (1 minute).</li>
                    <li>Second crossing: Person 3 and Person 4 cross together (10 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Return: Person 2 goes back with the torch (2 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Final crossing: Person 1 and Person 2 cross together again (2 minutes).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Total time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The shortest time is 17 minutes.</p>

                <h3>3. Logic-based Mathematical Riddles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 3: The Two Sons Riddle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> A man is looking at a picture of someone. His friend asks, “Who are you looking at?”
                    The man replies, “Brothers and sisters, I have none. But the father of the person in the picture is
                    my father’s son.” Who is in the picture?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The man says, "The father of the person in the picture is my father’s son."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the man has no brothers, "my father’s son" must refer to himself.</li>
                    <li>Therefore, the person in the picture is his son.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The person in the picture is his son.</p>

                <h3>4. Age-related Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 4: The Age Difference Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> A father is 30 years older than his son. In 10 years, the father will be three times
                    as old as the son. How old are the father and the son?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>Let the son's age be <i>x</i>. Then the father's age is <i>x + 30</i>.</p>
                <p>In 10 years, the son will be <i>x + 10</i>, and the father will be <i>x + 40</i>.</p>
                <p>According to the problem, in 10 years, the father will be three times the son's age:</p>
                <p><i>x + 40 = 3(x + 10)</i></p>
                <p>Simplifying:</p>
                <p><i>x + 40 = 3x + 30</i></p>
                <p><i>40 - 30 = 3x - x</i></p>
                <p><i>10 = 2x</i></p>
                <p><i>x = 5</i></p>
                <p>So, the son is 5 years old, and the father is <i>5 + 30 = 35</i> years old.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The son is 5 years old, and the father is 35 years old.</p>

                <h3>5. Pattern and Sequence Puzzles</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 5: The Number Sequence</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, __?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <p>The numbers are perfect squares:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>1<sup>2</sup> = 1</i></li>
                    <li><i>2<sup>2</sup> = 4</i></li>
                    <li><i>3<sup>2</sup> = 9</i></li>
                    <li><i>4<sup>2</sup> = 16</i></li>
                    <li><i>5<sup>2</sup> = 25</i></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The next number in the sequence will be <i>6<sup>2</sup> = 36</i>.</p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The next number is 36.</p>

                <h3>6. Coin-related Puzzle</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 6: The Weighing Puzzle</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> You have 12 identical-looking coins. One of them is either heavier or lighter than
                    the others. You have a balance scale and can only use it three times. How do you find the odd coin
                    and determine whether it is heavier or lighter?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the 12 coins into three groups of 4 coins each.</li>
                    <li>Weigh two groups (Group A and Group B). There are three possible outcomes:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If they balance, the odd coin is in Group C.</li>
                            <li>If Group A is heavier or lighter, the odd coin is in Group A or Group B.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now take the 4 coins from the group that contains the odd coin and divide them into three coins
                        and one coin.</li>
                    <li>Weigh the three coins against each other:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If they balance, the odd coin is the one not weighed, and you can determine whether it
                                is heavier or lighter.</li>
                            <li>If they do not balance, you will know which coin is the odd one and whether it is
                                heavier or lighter.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> This method will find the odd coin and determine if it is heavier or lighter in three
                    weighings.</p>

                <h3>7. Logical Deduction Puzzle</h3>
                <h4>Puzzle 7: The Light Bulb Problem</h4>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> You are in a room with three switches, each controlling one of three light bulbs in
                    another room. You can’t see the bulbs from where the switches are, and you can only enter the room
                    with the bulbs once. How do you determine which switch controls which bulb?</p>
                <h4>Solution:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn on the first switch and leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>After a few minutes, turn off the first switch and turn on the second switch.</li>
                    <li>Now, enter the room with the bulbs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The bulb that is on corresponds to the second switch.</li>
                            <li>The bulb that is off and warm corresponds to the first switch (since it was on for a
                                while and then turned off).</li>
                            <li>The bulb that is off and cold corresponds to the third switch.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>A statement is a sentence that conveys some information.</li>
                    <li>An assumption is something taken as true for the sake of argument, even if it may not be
                        explicitly stated.</li>
                    <li>The goal in problems involving statements and assumptions is to determine whether an assumption
                        logically follows from the statement provided.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>

                        explicitly mentioned.</li>
                    <li>An assumption is invalid if it goes beyond the information provided or introduces something that
                        contradicts the statement.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A ratio is a way of comparing two or more quantities, showing the relative size of two values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formula: The ratio of two quantities <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> is written as:</li>
                    <p><b>Ratio = a/b or a : b</b></p>
                    <li><b>Example 1:</b> If there are 3 apples and 2 oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is:</li>
                    <p><b>Ratio = 3/2 or 3 : 2</b></p>
                    <li><b>Example 2:</b> The ratio of boys to girls in a class is 4:5, meaning for every 4 boys, there
                        are 5 girls in the class.</li>

                <h2>Proportion</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A proportion is an equation that expresses the equality of two ratios. It is typically written

                <h3>Steps for Alligation Alternate:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Step 1: Write the concentration or price of the two components (substances) you are mixing.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Find the desired or mean concentration/price of the mixture.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Subtract the mean value from the concentration/price of each of the substances.</li>
                    <li>Step 4: The differences you obtain are the parts in which the two substances must be mixed.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A weighted average is used when some values in a dataset are more important or have more
                        significance than others. Instead of each value contributing equally to the average, each value
                        is multiplied by a weight that reflects its importance.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Formula for Weighted Average:</h4>
                <p><b>Weighted Average = (x₁ × w₁) + (x₂ × w₂) + ... + (xₙ × wₙ) / (w₁ + w₂ + ... + wₙ)</b></p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><i>x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ</i> are the values.</li>
                    <li><i>w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ</i> are the corresponding weights.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The sum of the weights is the total weight, and the formula computes the average considering these
                    weights.</p>

            <h1>4. Partnership & Investments</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Partnership</h2>
                <p>In a partnership, two or more individuals or entities come together to run a business, share profits,
                    and bear the losses according to a mutually agreed ratio. The agreement usually specifies how
                    profits, losses, and capital will be divided among the partners.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts in Partnership</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Capital Contribution:</b> This refers to the amount of money or assets each partner invests
                        in the business. The partnership ratio (profit-sharing ratio) is often based on the amount of
                        capital invested.</li>
                    <li><b>Profit Sharing Ratio:</b> The ratio in which the partners will share the profits (or losses)
                        of the business. This can be based on their capital contribution or some other agreement.</li>
                    <li><b>Time Factor:</b> If the partners invest their capital for different periods, the time factor
                        is considered while calculating the profit-sharing ratio. The effective contribution of each
                        partner is their capital multiplied by the time for which it is invested.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Formula for Partnership</h3>
                <p>If the capital contributions of two partners <b>P₁</b> and <b>P₂</b> for different time periods
                    <b>T₁</b> and <b>T₂</b> are known, then the share of profits can be calculated using the following
                    formula:
                </p>

                <p><b>Profit of Partner 1 = (P₁ × T₁) / (P₁ × T₁ + P₂ × T₂) × Total Profit</b></p>
                <p><b>Profit of Partner 2 = (P₂ × T₂) / (P₁ × T₁ + P₂ × T₂) × Total Profit</b></p>

                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>P₁</b> and <b>P₂</b> are the amounts of capital invested by Partner 1 and Partner 2,
                        respectively.</li>
                    <li><b>T₁</b> and <b>T₂</b> are the time periods for which the capital is invested.</li>
                    <li><b>Total Profit</b> is the total amount of profit or loss made by the business.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Types of Partnership</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fixed Capital Partnership:</b> In this type of partnership, the capital contribution of the
                        partners remains constant throughout the business period.</li>
                    <li><b>Fluctuating Capital Partnership:</b> Here, the capital contribution of the partners may
                        change during the course of the business, i.e., the partners can add or withdraw capital as per
                        their needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>Investments</h2>
                <p>An investment involves putting money or capital into a business or asset with the expectation of
                    receiving a return or profit over time. In partnerships, the initial investment and any subsequent
                    additions to it determine the profit-sharing ratio among the partners.</p>

                <h3>Key Terms in Investments</h3>

                    <li><b>Time Period (T):</b> The duration for which the investment is made.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Simple Interest (SI)</h3>
                <p>The interest earned on the principal over a period of time, calculated using the formula:</p>
                <p><b>SI = (P × R × T) / 100</b></p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Inflation Calculation</h2>
                <p>Inflation is generally measured as the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over a
                    specific period of time (usually annually).</p>
                <p>The formula to calculate inflation is:</p>
                <p><b>Inflation Rate = (CPI at End of Year - CPI at Beginning of Year) / CPI at Beginning of Year ×
                        100</b></p>
                <p>Where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>CPI</b> (Consumer Price Index) is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a
                        basket of consumer goods and services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example 1: Inflation Calculation</h3>
                <p><b>Problem:</b> The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in January was 120 and in December it was 130. What is
                    the inflation rate for the year?</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b> Using the formula for inflation:</p>
                <p><b>Inflation Rate = (130 - 120) / 120 × 100</b></p>
                <p>Inflation Rate = <b>10 / 120 × 100 = 8.33%</b></p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The inflation rate is 8.33%.</p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Shares and Stocks</h2>
                <p>Shares and stocks are similar concepts, but they have subtle differences.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Share:</b> A share represents a unit of ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you own
                        a portion of the company and are entitled to a share of its profits (dividends) and voting
                        rights at general meetings.</li>
                    <li><b>Stock:</b> Stock refers to the collective ownership in a company, which consists of multiple
                        shares. It’s often used to refer to ownership in a company without specifying the number of
                        shares.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of Shares</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Equity Shares (Common Shares):</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Represent ownership in a company.</li>
                            <li>Carry voting rights and entitle the shareholder to dividends.</li>
                            <li>Dividends depend on the company’s profit.</li>
                            <li>Risk is higher, as equity shareholders are paid after debenture holders and preference
                                shareholders in case of liquidation.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Preference Shares:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide a fixed dividend before equity shareholders receive any.</li>
                            <li>Generally, preference shareholders do not have voting rights.</li>
                            <li>In case of liquidation, preference shareholders are paid before equity shareholders.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Features of Shares:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Face Value:</b> The nominal or original value of a share, typically set by the company.</li>
                    <li><b>Market Value:</b> The price at which shares are traded in the stock market.</li>
                    <li><b>Dividend:</b> A share of the company's profits paid to shareholders.</li>
                    <li><b>Capital Gain:</b> Profit made by selling shares at a higher price than the purchase price.

                <h2>Debentures</h2>
                <p>A debenture is a debt instrument issued by companies to raise funds. It represents a loan taken by
                    the company from debenture holders. Unlike shares, debentures do not offer ownership but instead
                    offer fixed interest payments to the debenture holders.</p>

                <h3>Key Features of Debentures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Debt Instrument:</b> Debentures are a form of borrowing for the company, and they are not
                        ownership in the company.</li>
                    <li><b>Fixed Interest:</b> Debenture holders receive fixed interest, also known as coupon rates,
                        regularly.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Secured and Unsecured Debentures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Secured Debentures:</b> Backed by the company’s assets as collateral.</li>
                    <li><b>Unsecured Debentures:</b> Not backed by any specific assets, and hence, considered riskier.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Types of Debentures:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Convertible Debentures:</b> Can be converted into a specified number of equity shares after a
                        certain period.</li>
                    <li><b>Non-Convertible Debentures:</b> Cannot be converted into shares but offer higher interest
                        rates due to the lack of convertibility.</li>
                    <li><b>Redeemable Debentures:</b> Can be redeemed after a certain period.</li>
                    <li><b>Irredeemable Debentures:</b> Cannot be redeemed but continue to pay interest.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>Problem:</b> A company has issued 1000 equity shares of face value ₹100 each. The company declares
                    a 10% dividend. What is the total dividend earned by a shareholder with 50 shares?</p>
                <p><b>Solution:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dividend per share = 10% of ₹100 = ₹10</li>
                    <li>Total Dividend = 50 shares × ₹10 = ₹500</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Answer:</b> The shareholder will earn ₹500 as dividend.</p>
