            <div class="topic-description">
                <p>The period from 1857 to 1947 in India was marked by significant changes, both politically and
                    socially. India witnessed the rise of nationalist movements, colonial exploitation, and the ultimate
                    struggle for independence. Below is a detailed overview of Modern India and the Freedom Struggle.
                </p>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Early Nationalist Movements (1857–1900)</h2>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>First War of Indian Independence (1857)</h3>
                <p><b>Causes:</b> The revolt was triggered by various factors, including political, economic, social,
                    and cultural grievances. The immediate cause was the introduction of the Enfield rifle which used
                    cartridges greased with animal fat, offending both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Key Figures:</b> Mangal Pandey, Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, Begum Hazrat Mahal, and Nana Saheb
                        were key leaders of the rebellion.</li>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The rebellion was crushed by the British, but it marked the beginning of the
                        Indian independence movement. It led to the end of the Mughal Empire and the direct control of
                        India by the British Crown (the British Raj).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Indian National Congress (INC) Formation (1885)</h3>
                <p><b>Formation:</b> The Indian National Congress was founded by Allan Octavian Hume in 1885, with the
                    aim of promoting political dialogue between the British and the Indian elite.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Early Leadership:</b> Leaders like Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee and Dadabhai Naoroji were early
                        advocates for Indian rights.</li>
                    <li><b>Moderate Phase:</b> The early Congress was dominated by moderate leaders who believed in
                        constitutional reform and dialogue with the British. They aimed to achieve self-governance for
                        India within the British Empire.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Swadeshi Movement (1905–1908)</h3>
                <p><b>Context:</b> The Partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon in 1905 was a key event that sparked
                    nationalist movements. The partition aimed to divide the largely Bengali-speaking population along
                    religious lines to weaken the nationalist movement.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Leader:</b> Leaders like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Lala Lajpat Rai, and Aurobindo Ghosh
                        spearheaded the movement.</li>
                    <li><b>Methods:</b> The movement promoted Swadeshi (self-reliance), Boycott of British goods, and
                        Promotion of Indian industries.</li>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement, despite being suppressed, led to the rise of radical nationalism
                        and the demand for complete independence (Purna Swaraj).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Ghadar Movement (1913–1917)</h3>
                <p><b>Objective:</b> The Ghadar Party was formed by Indians in North America to liberate India from
                    British rule through an armed revolution.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Key Figures:</b> Lala Hardayal, Baba Gurdit Singh, and Kartar Singh Sarabha were prominent
                        leaders.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact:</b> Although unsuccessful, it highlighted the dissatisfaction of Indians abroad and
                        contributed to the radicalization of the independence movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Home Rule Movement (1916–1919)</h2>
                <p><b>Leader:</b> Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant</p>
                <p>The Home Rule Movement aimed at achieving self-rule within the British Empire. It was based on the
                    principle of self-government for Indians and sought to place pressure on the British government to
                    allow Indian participation in decision-making.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Impact:</b> The movement greatly raised political consciousness and mobilized masses across
                        India.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Gandhian Era (1915–1947)</h2>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Gandhi’s Arrival and Leadership</h3>
                <p>Mahatma Gandhi returned to India in 1915 from South Africa, where he had developed his ideas of
                    Satyagraha (nonviolent resistance). Gandhi’s leadership turned the Indian struggle for independence
                    into a mass movement that included people from all walks of life.</p>

                <h3>Key<hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;"> Movements Led by Gandhi</h3>

                <h4>Champaran Satyagraha (1917)</h4>
                <p>Gandhi led the first successful Satyagraha movement in Champaran (Bihar) against the exploitation of
                    indigo farmers by British planters.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> This victory marked the beginning of Gandhian mass movements in India.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Kheda Satyagraha (1918)</h4>
                <p>Farmers in Kheda (Gujarat) were suffering from high taxes and crop failure. Gandhi supported their
                    struggle for tax relief.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The British government relented, and the farmers were granted relief.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–1922)</h4>
                <p>After the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919, Gandhi launched the Non-Cooperation Movement, urging
                    Indians to boycott British institutions and goods.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement was widespread, and people from all sections of society
                        participated.</li>
                    <li><b>Suspension:</b> The movement was suspended by Gandhi in 1922 after the Chauri Chaura incident
                        where protesters turned violent.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Salt March (1930)</h4>
                <p>Gandhi led the Dandi March to defy the British monopoly on salt production.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Impact:</b> The Salt March became a symbol of India’s defiance against British rule and
                        garnered worldwide attention.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Civil Disobedience Movement (1930–1934)</h4>
                <p>The Salt March was part of a broader movement that involved breaking laws to protest British colonial
                    policies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement gained widespread support, and many Indians were arrested,
                        including Gandhi.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Quit India Movement (1942)</h4>
                <p>During World War II, Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement demanding an immediate end to British
                    rule in India.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Outcome:</b> The movement was crushed, but it made it clear that India was no longer willing
                        to tolerate British rule.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Revolutionary Movements</h3>
                <p>Alongside Gandhi’s nonviolent movement, there were revolutionary groups seeking armed resistance

                    <li><b>Key Groups:</b> Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), Jugantar, and Anushilan

                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h3>Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army (INA)</h3>
                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent leader who disagreed with Gandhi’s methods and called for more
                    radical approaches to attain freedom.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bose's Efforts:</b> Bose sought international support for India’s freedom struggle,
                        particularly from Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan during World War II.</li>
                    <li><b>INA's Role:</b> Though INA was defeated, Bose's efforts inspired many Indians to fight for
                        independence.</li>

                <h2>ix. Role in the Global Economy</h2>
                <p>The WTO plays a critical role in ensuring the stability of the global trading system. By providing a
                    rules-based framework, it helps reduce the risk of trade wars and ensures that disputes are handled
                    systematically.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Conditionality and Austerity:</b> IMF lending often comes with conditions, such as austerity
                        measures (cutting public spending, raising taxes), which critics argue may harm vulnerable
                        populations and slow down economic recovery.</li>
                    <li><b>Influence of Major Economies:</b> The voting system based on quotas gives wealthier nations
                        more power in IMF decision-making, leading to accusations of unequal representation.</li>
                    <li><b>Impact on Sovereignty:</b> Some countries feel that IMF programs undermine their ability to
                        make independent economic decisions and prioritize social welfare.</li>

                        many countries are not on track to meet their NDCs, indicating a gap between current action and
                        the needed efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C.</li>
                    <li><b>Geopolitical Tensions:</b> Changes in leadership and policies in major emitting countries can
                        affect the global commitment to the agreement (e.g., the U.S. withdrawal under President Trump
                        and rejoining under President Biden).</li>
                    <li><b>Financing Issues:</b> Adequate funding for climate adaptation and mitigation, especially for
                        developing countries, remains a significant challenge.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Economic Growth:</b> Encourages innovation, enhances productivity, and boosts economic growth
                        by allowing countries to specialize in what they do best.</li>
                    <li><b>Access to Resources:</b> Enables countries to access resources and products that are
                        unavailable or expensive to produce domestically.</li>
                    <li><b>Employment:</b> Global trade creates jobs by stimulating the growth of businesses involved in
                        production, distribution, and logistics.</li>
                    <li><b>Cultural Exchange:</b> Encourages the exchange of ideas, technology, and cultural goods,

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Absolute Advantage (Adam Smith):</b> A country has an absolute advantage over another if it
                        can produce a good more efficiently (i.e., using fewer resources).</li>
                    <li><b>Comparative Advantage (David Ricardo):</b> Even if a country doesn’t have an absolute
                        advantage, it can still benefit from trade by specializing in producing goods for which it has a
                        lower opportunity cost.</li>
                    <li><b>Heckscher-Ohlin Theory:</b> Trade patterns are determined by a country’s relative abundance
                        of factors of production (like labor, capital, land). Countries export goods that use their
                        abundant factors of production and import goods that require factors they lack.</li>
                    <li><b>New Trade Theory:</b> Emphasizes economies of scale and network effects, suggesting that
                        large firms dominate in international trade due to their ability to exploit cost advantages.
                    </li>

                        tariffs and other trade barriers.</li>
                    <li><b>Multilateral Agreements:</b> Involves multiple countries agreeing to terms for trade, such as
                        the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements or regional trade agreements like the North
                        American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the European Union (EU), or the Comprehensive and
                        Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).</li>
                    <li><b>Free Trade Areas (FTA):</b> These agreements reduce or eliminate trade barriers like tariffs,
                        but each country can set its own trade policies with non-member nations (e.g., ASEAN Free Trade
                        Area).</li>
                    <li><b>Customs Unions:</b> A group of countries that not only remove tariffs between members but
                        also adopt a common external tariff (e.g., European Union).</li>
                </ul>

                        information and within constraints, such as time, knowledge, or cognitive capacity. They settle
                        for a satisfactory solution, not necessarily the best one.</li>
                    <li><b>Intuitive Decision-Making:</b> Decisions are made based on instinct or gut feeling rather
                        than rational analysis. This model is often used when decisions need to be made quickly, and
                        there is little information available.</li>
                    <li><b>Incremental Decision-Making:</b> A gradual approach where decisions are made in small steps,
                        often adjusting as new information becomes available.</li>
                    <li><b>Creative Decision-Making:</b> Involves brainstorming and out-of-the-box thinking to generate
                        innovative solutions when facing complex problems.</li>

                        decision is worth pursuing.</li>
                    <li><b>Decision Matrix:</b> Assign weights to various criteria (e.g., cost, time, impact) and
                        evaluate alternatives to make a more objective decision.</li>
                    <li><b>Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule):</b> Focus on the 20% of actions or issues that will lead to 80%

                <p><b>Definition:</b> A ratio is a relationship between two or more numbers that indicates how many
                    times the first number contains the second.</p>
                <p><b>Formula:</b></p>
                <p>Ratio of A to B = A / B</p>

                <h3>Types of Ratios:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simplifying Ratios:</b> Divide both terms of the ratio by their greatest common divisor
                        (GCD).</li>
                    <li><b>Dividing a Quantity in a Given Ratio:</b>
                        <p>If a quantity is divided in the ratio A:B, then the parts are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Part 1 = A / (A + B)</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> Ratio of ages of A and B: 3:4 → If A’s age is 30 years, B’s age = (4 / 3) × 30 =
                        40 years.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Time and Distance</h2>
                <p><b>Basic Formula:</b> Distance = Speed × Time</p>

                <h3>Speed, Time, and Distance:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speed:</b> Speed = Distance / Time</li>
                    <li><b>Time:</b> Time = Distance / Speed</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Relative Speed:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>When two objects move in opposite directions:</b> Relative Speed = Speed of A + Speed of B
                    </li>
                    <li><b>When moving in the same direction:</b> Relative Speed = |Speed of A - Speed of B|</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Time and Work:</h3>
                <p>If A can complete a work in x days and B in y days, their combined work time is:</p>

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>i. Graphs and Charts</h2>
                <p>Graphs and charts are visual representations of data that help interpret large amounts of information
                    in a simplified manner.</p>

                <h3>Types of Graphs and Charts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bar Chart:</b> A graph that uses bars to represent data. It's useful for comparing quantities
                        across categories.</li>
                    <li><b>Line Graph:</b> A graph that shows data points connected by a line, useful for displaying
                        trends over time.</li>
                    <li><b>Pie Chart:</b> A circular chart divided into sectors, representing proportions of a whole.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Histogram:</b> Similar to a bar chart but used for frequency distribution of continuous data.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Scatter Plot:</b> A chart used to display the relationship between two continuous variables.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Interpretation:</b> The process of analyzing and extracting meaningful insights from the data
                        displayed in the graph or chart.</li>
                    <li><b>Scale and Units:</b> Ensure that the scale and units used in the graph or chart are clearly
                        understood before interpreting the data.</li>
                    <li><b>Trends:</b> Identify increasing, decreasing, or constant trends in data by examining the
                        chart or graph.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>ii. Probability</h2>
                <p><b>Definition:</b> Probability is the measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It is
                    expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event will not happen, and 1 means it will
                    definitely happen.</p>

                <h3>Basic Formula:</h3>
                <p><b>Probability (P) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)</b></p>

                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Complementary Events:</b> The probability of an event not happening is 1 minus the
                        probability of it happening (P(not A) = 1 - P(A)).</li>
                    <li><b>Independent Events:</b> The occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of another
                        event (P(A and B) = P(A) × P(B)).</li>
                    <li><b>Mutually Exclusive Events:</b> Two events cannot happen at the same time (P(A or B) = P(A) +
                        P(B)).</li>
                    <li><b>Conditional Probability:</b> The probability of an event occurring given that another event
                        has already occurred (P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Probability Distributions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Binomial Distribution:</b> A distribution for binary outcomes, where there are two possible
                        outcomes (success/failure).</li>
                    <li><b>Normal Distribution:</b> A bell-shaped probability distribution often used to model natural
                        occurrences.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>iii. Simplifications</h2>
                <p><b>Definition:</b> Simplification involves breaking down complex expressions or calculations to make
                    them easier to solve, often using basic arithmetic rules.</p>

                <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simplifying Fractions:</b> Reduce fractions to their simplest form by dividing both the
                        numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).</li>
                    <li><b>Decimals to Fractions:</b> Convert decimal numbers to fractions by expressing them as a
                        fraction of 10, 100, etc., depending on the number of decimal places.</li>
                    <li><b>Percentage Calculations:</b> Use shortcuts for calculating percentages:
                        <ul>
                            <li>10% of a number is the number divided by 10.</li>
                            <li>20% of a number is the number divided by 5.</li>
                            <li>50% of a number is the number divided by 2.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Multiplication and Division Shortcuts:</b> Use tricks like multiplying by 5, 10, or 50 for
                        quick calculations.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Common Simplification Techniques:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Rationalizing Denominators:</b> Convert expressions with roots in the denominator into an
                        equivalent expression without roots by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the
                        conjugate.</li>
                    <li><b>Approximations:</b> Use rounding or approximations to simplify calculations when exact values
                        are not necessary.</li>
                    <li><b>Use of Algebraic Identities:</b> Use standard algebraic identities (e.g., (a +
                        b)<sup>2</sup>, a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>) to simplify complex expressions.</li>
