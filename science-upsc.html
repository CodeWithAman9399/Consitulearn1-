                </ul>

                <h3>Interception Phases</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Boost Phase:</b> The missile is intercepted shortly after launch during the initial boost
                        stage.</li>
                    <li><b>Midcourse Phase:</b> The missile is intercepted during its flight through space.</li>
                    <li><b>Terminal Phase:</b> The missile is intercepted during re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere,
                        just before impact.</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>2. Nuclear Weapons & Treaties</h1>
            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Nuclear weapons are powerful explosives that derive their energy from nuclear reactions (fission or
                    fusion). These weapons have the potential to cause massive destruction and loss of life, and their
                    development has dramatically altered the global security landscape. Various international treaties
                    have been established to regulate the possession, use, and proliferation of nuclear weapons to
                    reduce the risks of nuclear conflict.</p>
                    <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Nuclear Weapons</h2>
                <p>Nuclear weapons are divided into two main categories based on the type of nuclear reaction they use:
                </p>

                <h3>Fission Weapons (Atomic Bombs)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the process of nuclear fission (splitting of atoms, such as uranium or plutonium) to release
                        energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Examples:</b> Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs (used in World War II).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fusion Weapons (Hydrogen Bombs)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use nuclear fusion (combining light atoms like hydrogen to form heavier elements) to release
                        energy.</li>
                    <li>Fusion bombs are far more powerful than fission bombs.</li>
                    <li><b>Example:</b> The Tsar Bomba, tested by the Soviet Union in 1961, is the most powerful
                        thermonuclear bomb ever detonated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Characteristics of Nuclear Weapons</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Devastating Destructive Power:</b> Can obliterate entire cities and cause long-term
                        environmental damage due to radiation.</li>
                    <li><b>Radiation:</b> Nuclear explosions emit harmful radiation, leading to immediate deaths and
                        long-term health issues like cancer.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Fallout:</b> Radioactive particles released into the atmosphere can spread globally,
                        contaminating the environment for decades.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Nuclear Proliferation and the Threat</h2>
                <p>Nuclear proliferation refers to the spread of nuclear weapons to countries that do not currently
                    possess them. This raises significant concerns about global security, as more nations acquiring
                    nuclear weapons increases the risk of nuclear conflict, accidents, or weapons falling into the hands
                    of non-state actors (e.g., terrorist groups).</p>

                <h3>Key Concerns</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Regional Instability:</b> Countries that develop nuclear weapons may trigger arms races, with
                        neighboring nations seeking to acquire their own arsenals in response.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Terrorism:</b> The risk of nuclear materials being stolen and used by terrorist
                        organizations to create "dirty bombs" or other forms of nuclear weapons.</li>
                    <li><b>Accidental Launches:</b> The possibility of a miscalculation or error leading to a nuclear
                        conflict remains a concern due to the destructive power of these weapons.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Nuclear Treaties & Agreements</h2>
                <p>Several international treaties and agreements have been signed to mitigate the risks posed by nuclear
                    weapons, aiming to promote disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control.</p>

                        foundation for global efforts to control nuclear weapons.</li>
                    <li><b>Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) – 1996:</b> Prohibits all nuclear explosions for
                        both civilian and military purposes. Although widely adopted, it has not entered into force due
                        to a few key nations not ratifying it.</li>
                    <li><b>Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) & New START – 1991/2010:</b> Agreements between the
                        U.S. and Russia to reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads and delivery systems. New
                        START continues these efforts with further reductions and regular inspections.</li>
                    <li><b>The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) – 2017:</b> The first legally binding
                        international agreement that categorically prohibits nuclear weapons, aiming for their total
                        elimination. Over 80 countries have signed it, though nuclear-armed states have not joined.</li>
                    <li><b>The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) – 1974:</b> A group of nuclear supplier countries that
                        control the export of materials and technologies that can be used to create nuclear weapons, to
                        prevent their spread.</li>
                    <li><b>The Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT) – 1963:</b> Prohibits nuclear weapons tests in the
                        atmosphere, underwater, and in space, allowing only underground tests to limit environmental
                        impact.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">

            <div class="topic-description">
                <h2>i. Vaccines</h2>
                <p><b>Definition:</b> Vaccines are biological preparations that provide immunity to a specific
                    infectious disease by stimulating the body’s immune system to recognize and fight pathogens like
                    viruses or bacteria.</p>

                <h3>Types of Vaccines:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Live Attenuated Vaccines:</b> Contain weakened forms of the pathogen (e.g., measles, mumps,
                        rubella (MMR) vaccine).</li>
                    <li><b>Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines:</b> Contain killed pathogens or inactivated toxins (e.g.,
                        polio, hepatitis A vaccine).</li>
                    <li><b>Subunit, Recombinant, or Conjugate Vaccines:</b> Contain pieces of the pathogen (e.g., HPV,
                        Hib vaccine).</li>
                    <li><b>mRNA Vaccines:</b> Contain messenger RNA (mRNA) that instructs cells to produce a protein
                        similar to the pathogen's, triggering an immune response (e.g., COVID-19 vaccines).</li>

                <h3>How Vaccines Work:</h3>
                <p>Vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and "remember" a specific pathogen without causing
                    the disease. If the body encounters the pathogen in the future, the immune system can respond more
                    quickly and effectively.</p>

                        diphtheria, tetanus, polio, measles, hepatitis B, and more, given at various ages, starting from
                        birth.</li>
                    <li><b>Routine Vaccinations:</b> Administered at regular intervals to maintain immunity (e.g.,
                        annual flu shots, childhood vaccines).</li>
                    <li><b>Catch-up Vaccination:</b> For individuals who missed vaccinations, particularly important in
                        children and young adults.</li>

                <h2>ii. Genetically Modified (GM) Crops: Overview</h2>
                <p>GM crops are plants that have been altered through genetic engineering to exhibit traits that are not
                    naturally present. These traits may include resistance to pests, tolerance to herbicides, improved
                    nutritional content, or better resistance to environmental stresses like drought.</p>

                <h3>A. Key Types of GM Crops</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bt Crops:</b> Genetically engineered to produce a toxin (from Bacillus thuringiensis) that is
                        harmful to specific pests. Common examples include Bt cotton, Bt maize, and Bt soybeans.</li>
                    <li><b>Herbicide-Tolerant Crops:</b> Crops like glyphosate-resistant soybeans, canola, and maize are
                        engineered to survive herbicide applications, making it easier to control weeds without damaging
                        the crops.</li>
                    <li><b>Drought-Tolerant Crops:</b> Crops like drought-tolerant maize and rice have been developed to
                        withstand water stress, improving food security in regions with unreliable rainfall.</li>
                    <li><b>Nutritionally Enhanced Crops:</b> Examples include Golden Rice, which has been modified to
                        produce higher levels of vitamin A to combat vitamin A deficiency.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>B. Benefits of GM Crops</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Improved Pest Control:</b> Bt crops reduce the need for chemical pesticides, lowering costs

                <h1>1. Nuclear Reactors & Energy Generation: Short Notes</h1>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Nuclear Reactors: Overview</h2>
                <p>A nuclear reactor is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction,
                    primarily for generating energy. The heat produced from the reaction is used to generate steam,
                    which drives turbines connected to electrical generators, producing electricity. Nuclear reactors
                    are an essential part of nuclear power plants.</p>

                <h3>A. Key Components of a Nuclear Reactor</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fuel:</b> Uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the most commonly used fuels. These are fissile
                        materials that undergo nuclear fission to release energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Moderator:</b> A substance (usually water or graphite) used to slow down the fast-moving
                        neutrons produced during fission, making them more likely to cause further fission reactions.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Control Rods:</b> Made of materials that absorb neutrons (such as boron or cadmium), control
                        rods are inserted or withdrawn from the reactor core to regulate the rate of the chain reaction.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Coolant:</b> A liquid (such as water or gas) that absorbs heat from the reactor core and
                        transfers it to a steam generator, which then produces electricity.</li>
                    <li><b>Reactor Vessel:</b> A strong container that houses the fuel, moderator, and coolant and
                        maintains the high pressure and temperature required for the reaction.</li>
                    <li><b>Containment Structure:</b> A reinforced structure designed to contain radiation and prevent
                        its release into the environment in the event of an accident.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Types of Nuclear Reactors</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR):</b> The most common type of reactor. It uses water under
                        high pressure as both a coolant and a moderator. The water in the core is kept under pressure to
                        prevent it from boiling, and the heat is transferred to a secondary circuit that drives the
                        turbines.</li>
                    <li><b>Boiling Water Reactor (BWR):</b> In this reactor, water is allowed to boil in the reactor
                        core, and the resulting steam directly drives the turbine. This is simpler than a PWR but can be
                        less efficient.</li>
                    <li><b>Heavy Water Reactor (HWR):</b> Uses heavy water (deuterium oxide) as a moderator instead of
                        light water. Heavy water is more efficient at slowing down neutrons, allowing reactors to use
                        natural uranium as fuel.</li>
                    <li><b>Gas-cooled Reactor:</b> Uses carbon dioxide or helium as a coolant and graphite as a
                        moderator. This type of reactor can operate at higher temperatures and is used in certain
                        countries, including the UK.</li>
                    <li><b>Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR):</b> A type of reactor designed to generate more fissile material
                        than it consumes by converting non-fissile isotopes like uranium-238 into fissile material like
                        plutonium-239.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Nuclear Energy Generation: Process</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Fission:</b> The process begins when the nuclei of heavy elements like uranium-235
                        absorb neutrons and split into two smaller nuclei, releasing energy in the form of heat.</li>
                    <li><b>Heat Transfer:</b> The heat produced from fission is transferred to the coolant, which
                        absorbs the thermal energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Steam Production:</b> The coolant, often water, is heated to generate steam.</li>
                    <li><b>Turbine Rotation:</b> The steam drives turbines connected to an electrical generator.</li>
                    <li><b>Electricity Generation:</b> The mechanical energy from the turbines is converted into
                        electrical energy by the generator, which is then distributed through power grids.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Advantages of Nuclear Energy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>High Energy Density:</b> Nuclear reactions release millions of times more energy than
                        chemical reactions, making nuclear fuel highly efficient.</li>
                    <li><b>Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</b> Nuclear power generates electricity with little to no
                        direct carbon emissions, contributing to efforts to combat climate change.</li>
                    <li><b>Reliable Energy Supply:</b> Nuclear power plants operate continuously, providing a stable and
                        consistent energy supply unlike intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind.</li>
                    <li><b>Base-load Power:</b> Nuclear power is suitable for base-load electricity generation, which
                        means it can supply a constant amount of energy to the grid.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>v. Disadvantages & Challenges</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Waste:</b> The spent fuel from nuclear reactors remains radioactive and hazardous for
                        thousands of years. Safe disposal of nuclear waste remains a significant challenge.</li>
                    <li><b>Safety Concerns:</b> Accidents, though rare, can have catastrophic consequences, as seen in
                        incidents like Chernobyl (1986) and Fukushima (2011). Reactor meltdowns can lead to widespread
                        radiation contamination.</li>
                    <li><b>High Initial Costs:</b> Building nuclear power plants requires significant capital
                        investment, and the construction time is long.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Proliferation:</b> The technology used in nuclear reactors can also be used to
                        produce materials for nuclear weapons, raising concerns over security and proliferation.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vi. Nuclear Energy in the Global Context</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Countries Using Nuclear Power:</b> Countries like the USA, France, Russia, China, and Japan
                        have well-established nuclear power industries. France, for example, generates around 70% of its
                        electricity from nuclear power.</li>
                    <li><b>Global Trends:</b> Many countries are investing in nuclear energy to reduce dependence on
                        fossil fuels and meet climate goals. However, some nations are phasing out nuclear energy due to
                        safety concerns (e.g., Germany’s decision after Fukushima).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vii. Future of Nuclear Energy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):</b> These are smaller, scalable reactors designed to be safer
                        and more cost-effective than traditional nuclear reactors. They are seen as a potential solution
                        for decentralized energy production.</li>
                    <li><b>Fusion Power:</b> Researchers are working on nuclear fusion, the process of combining light
                        elements (like hydrogen) to produce energy, mimicking the sun’s process. Fusion offers the
                        potential for an almost limitless, clean energy source, but commercial reactors are still in the
                        experimental phase.</li>

                <p>India's nuclear policy is centered around maintaining a credible deterrence, ensuring energy
                    security, and adhering to a policy of no-first-use (NFU) of nuclear weapons. India has consistently
                    advocated for nuclear disarmament while maintaining a strategic nuclear posture for national
                    security.</p>

                <h3>A. Key Principles of India’s Nuclear Policy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>No-First-Use (NFU):</b> India has declared that it will not be the first to use nuclear
                        weapons in a conflict. However, it reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in retaliation if
                        attacked with them.</li>
                    <li><b>Credible Minimum Deterrence:</b> India maintains a policy of credible minimum deterrence,
                        meaning it aims to have enough nuclear weapons to inflict unacceptable damage in case of a
                        nuclear attack, but not necessarily to build an overwhelming arsenal.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Disarmament:</b> India has consistently advocated for global nuclear disarmament,
                        emphasizing that nuclear weapons should be eliminated in a phased and verifiable manner.</li>

                        weapon states with its nuclear weapons, aligning with the principles of the Non-Proliferation
                        Treaty (NPT), which it has not signed.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. India’s Nuclear Weapons and Delivery Systems</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Weapons:</b> India has developed nuclear weapons over the years and is believed to
                        have a stockpile of around 150-160 nuclear warheads (as of 2025). These weapons include both
                        fissile material-based bombs and thermonuclear (hydrogen) bombs.</li>
                    <li><b>Delivery Systems:</b> India has developed a range of delivery systems for nuclear weapons,
                        including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Land-based Missiles:</b> Prithvi, Agni series (Agni-I to Agni-V)</li>
                            <li><b>Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs):</b> K-15 and K-4</li>
                            <li><b>Air-based Delivery:</b> Aircraft like the Mirage-2000 and Sukhoi-30MKI are capable of
                                delivering nuclear bombs.</li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iii. Nuclear Doctrine of India</h2>
                <p>India’s nuclear doctrine is based on the following key points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Massive Retaliation:</b> In case of a nuclear attack on India or its allies, India will
                        respond with massive retaliation.</li>
                    <li><b>No First Use (NFU):</b> India will not use nuclear weapons first but reserves the right to
                        use them in retaliation against nuclear attacks.</li>
                    <li><b>Command and Control:</b> India has a well-established command and control structure,
                        including the Nuclear Command Authority (NCA), to ensure that nuclear weapons are used only
                        under strict conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>iv. Nuclear Agreements and Treaties Involving India</h2>
                <h3>A. Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</h3>
                <p>India is a signatory to the CTBT, which aims to ban all nuclear explosions. However, it has not
                    ratified the treaty, citing the need for a non-discriminatory, universal nuclear disarmament
                    framework. India has stated that it will not conduct nuclear tests unless there is a global ban on
                    nuclear testing.</p>

                <h3>B. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</h3>
                <p>India has consistently refused to sign the NPT, arguing that the treaty creates a divide between
                    nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, thus failing to address the issue of nuclear
                    disarmament. India’s position is that the treaty should lead to the elimination of nuclear weapons,
                    which is not currently achievable.</p>

                <h3>C. India–US Nuclear Deal (Civil Nuclear Agreement)</h3>
                <p>In 2005, India signed a landmark civil nuclear deal with the United States, formally known as the
                    US–India Civil Nuclear Agreement. This agreement allows India to access civilian nuclear technology
                    and fuel despite not being a signatory to the NPT. As part of the deal, India agreed to separate its
                    civilian and military nuclear programs and place its civilian nuclear facilities under International
                    Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards.</p>

                <h3>D. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</h3>
                <p>India has had a long-standing relationship with the IAEA and cooperates with it on nuclear safety,
                    peaceful nuclear energy use, and technology development. However, India has not allowed IAEA
                    inspections of its military nuclear facilities.</p>

                <h3>E. Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)</h3>
                <p>India has sought membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which controls the export of
                    nuclear materials and technology. However, its membership bid has faced opposition from countries
                    like China, which argues that India should sign the NPT first. In 2008, India was granted a waiver
                    by the NSG, allowing it to engage in nuclear commerce with member countries, despite not being a
                    signatory to the NPT.</p>

                <h3>F. Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT)</h3>
                <p>India supports a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty (FMCT), which aims to halt the production of fissile
                    material for nuclear weapons. India has emphasized that the treaty should not be limited to fissile
                    material production but should also include nuclear disarmament.</p>

                <h2>v. Nuclear Energy and India</h2>
                <p>India has focused on expanding its nuclear energy capacity to meet its growing energy needs and
                    reduce reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Civil Nuclear Program:</b> India operates a series of nuclear power plants and has plans to
                        significantly increase its nuclear power generation capacity in the future.</li>
                    <li><b>Thorium-Based Reactors:</b> India is working on developing thorium-based nuclear reactors due
                        to its large reserves of thorium, which is considered a safer and more sustainable alternative
                        to uranium.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>vi. India’s Nuclear Strategy and Global Relations</h2>
                <p>India’s nuclear policy is shaped by its strategic security needs, regional dynamics, and aspirations
                    for global influence. India views nuclear weapons as a deterrent against potential nuclear-armed
                    adversaries, primarily Pakistan and China. India has maintained a policy of nuclear restraint,
                    emphasizing credible deterrence rather than nuclear escalation.</p>

                <h3>Regional Dynamics:</h3>
                <p>India’s nuclear capabilities and policies influence its relations with neighboring countries,
                    particularly Pakistan, which also possesses nuclear weapons, and China, which has a significant
                    nuclear arsenal.</p>

                <h1>3. Nuclear Fusion vs. Fission: Short Notes</h1>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>i. Nuclear Fission</h2>
                <p>Nuclear fission is the process where the nucleus of a heavy atom (usually Uranium-235 or
                    Plutonium-239) splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.</p>

                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Process:</b> A heavy nucleus absorbs a neutron, becomes unstable, and splits into two smaller
                        nuclei, along with a few free neutrons and a large amount of energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Energy Produced:</b> The energy released is in the form of heat, which is used to generate
                        electricity.</li>
                    <li><b>Byproducts:</b> The fission process produces radioactive waste, which remains hazardous for
                        thousands of years.</li>
                    <li><b>Control:</b> Fission can be controlled using control rods (e.g., in a nuclear reactor) to
                        regulate the rate of reaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Applications:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Power Plants:</b> Fission is the process used in nuclear power plants to generate
                        electricity.</li>
                    <li><b>Nuclear Weapons:</b> Fission is also the basis for the development of nuclear bombs (atomic
                        bombs).</li>
                </ul>
                <hr style="height: 1px; background-color: black; border: none;">
                <h2>ii. Nuclear Fusion</h2>
                <p>Nuclear fusion is the process where two light atomic nuclei (usually isotopes of hydrogen like
                    Deuterium and Tritium) combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.
                </p>

                <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Process:</b> Two light nuclei collide and fuse under extreme pressure and temperature,
                        forming a heavier nucleus and releasing energy.</li>
                    <li><b>Energy Produced:</b> The energy produced is much higher than that of fission because the mass
                        difference between the reactants and the products is greater.</li>
                    <li><b>Byproducts:</b> Fusion typically produces harmless byproducts, such as neutrons, and less
                        radioactive waste.</li>
                    <li><b>Control:</b> Fusion is difficult to control because it requires extremely high temperatures
                        (millions of degrees) to overcome the repulsion between the positively charged nuclei.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Applications:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Stellar Fusion:</b> Fusion is the process that powers the Sun and other stars.</li>
                    <li><b>Future Power Generation:</b> Scientists are working on controlled fusion for power
                        generation, but it remains experimental due to the challenges in maintaining the necessary
                        conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>v. Future Prospects</h2>
                <p>Fission is already a practical and widespread method of energy generation, but concerns about waste
                    and safety continue. Fusion, though promising, requires overcoming significant technological and
                    engineering challenges. If successful, fusion has the potential to provide nearly limitless, clean
                    energy.</p>
